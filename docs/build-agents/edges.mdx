Edges connect nodes, defining the possible paths a conversation can take through your Agent Graph. They determine the flow logic and create structured conversational experiences.

### Functionality

- **Connections:** Edges direct flow from a source node to a target node.
- **Directionality:** Each edge has a specific direction, flowing from one node to another.
- **Visual Representation:** Displayed as arrows on the Canvas.

### Conditional Edges

A powerful feature of edges is the ability to add conditions, allowing for dynamic conversation paths based on context:

- **Natural Language Conditions:** Write conditions in plain English that the agent will interpret.
- **Context Awareness:** Conditions are evaluated based on the current conversation state, including user inputs and any variables.
- **Multiple Paths:** When a node has multiple outgoing edges, the agent evaluates the condition associated with each edge after executing the source node's logic.
- **Path Selection:** The agent will follow the outgoing edge whose condition evaluates to true.

### Examples

**Example 1: Simple Conditional Routing**
```
Condition: User asks about pricing
```

**Example 2: Intent Detection**
```
Condition: User wants to track their order
```

**Example 3: Entity-Based Routing**
```
Condition: User mentions t-shirts or apparel
```

**Example 4: Complex Logic**
```
Condition: User is a returning customer AND is asking about premium products
```

### Best Practices

- **Clear Conditions:** Make conditions clear and distinct to avoid ambiguity
- **Condition Testing:** Test conditions thoroughly with various user inputs
- **Simplicity:** Keep conditions focused on a single concept when possible

## Building Complex Flows

By combining nodes and conditional edges, you can build sophisticated conversation flows that adapt to user inputs and context. Consider these patterns:

- **Decision Trees:** Use conditional edges to create branching paths based on user choices
- **Information Collection:** Route through different nodes to gather specific information
- **Error Handling:** Create paths for handling misunderstandings or invalid inputs
- **Context Switching:** Allow users to change topics with edges that detect new intents
