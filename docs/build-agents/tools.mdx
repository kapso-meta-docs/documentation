title: Tools reference
description: Complete reference of tools available

Tools are the building blocks that give your agents superpowers. They enable agents to interact with users, navigate conversations, access knowledge, and integrate with external systems. Each node type comes with a carefully selected set of tools designed for its specific purpose.

<Note>
💡 **Pro tip:** Reference tools by their exact names in your prompts to help the agent understand when to use them.
