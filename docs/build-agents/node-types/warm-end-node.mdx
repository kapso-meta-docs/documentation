The Warm End Node provides a graceful way to conclude conversations while giving users a final opportunity to ask questions or provide feedback.

### Purpose & Functionality

Marks a flow endpoint allowing for a graceful conclusion. Its prompt should typically invite final user questions or feedback. After a configured timeout without further interaction leading to a resume, the execution fully finalizes.

This creates a more natural ending to conversations rather than an abrupt stop.

### Configuration

- **Name:** A label for the node on the Canvas
- **Prompt:** Instructions for concluding the conversation
- **timeoutMinutes:** How long to wait for a user response before fully ending (default: 5 minutes)

### Use Cases

- Gracefully ending conversations
- Allowing a window for final questions
- Gathering feedback at the end of an interaction
- Confirming all needs have been met
- Providing closing information or next steps

### Example

**Configuration:**
```json
{
  "timeoutMinutes": 10
}
```

**Prompt:**
```
Thank the customer for their time and ask if there's anything else they need help with before concluding.
Let them know they can start a new conversation anytime by sending a message.
```

### Comparison with End Node

While the standard End Node immediately terminates the conversation flow, the Warm End Node:
- Allows for a more natural conclusion
- Provides a window for final questions
- Only finalizes after the timeout period
- Can be resumed if the user responds within the timeout
