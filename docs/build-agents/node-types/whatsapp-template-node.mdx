The WhatsApp Template Node allows your agent to send pre-approved message templates through WhatsApp, essential for initiating conversations or sending messages outside the 24-hour window.

### Purpose & Functionality

Sends pre-approved WhatsApp message templates, which are required for initiating conversations or sending notifications outside the 24-hour messaging window. Can dynamically fill template parameters using variables (`#{variable}`).

Primarily operates as a notification, it only pauses execution if the `waitForResponse` flag is explicitly set in its configuration.

### Configuration

- **Name:** A label for the node on the Canvas
- **Associated WhatsApp Configuration:** The WhatsApp Business Account to use
- **Selected WhatsApp Template:** Choose from your approved templates
- **Template Parameters:** Values to fill in variable placeholders in the template
- **Target Phone Number:** Recipient's phone number (can use a variable)
- **waitForResponse:** Boolean flag to control if execution should pause after sending

### Use Cases

- Sending notifications
- Initiating conversations
- Re-engaging customers after the 24-hour window
- Sending standardized messages that require pre-approval

### Example

**Configuration:**
```json
{
  "whatsAppConfiguration": "default",
  "template": "order_confirmation",
  "parameters": {
    "1": "#{order_number}",
    "2": "#{delivery_date}"
  },
  "phoneNumber": "#{customer_phone}",
  "waitForResponse": true
}
```

**Template Content:**
```
Your order #{{1}} has been confirmed and will be delivered on {{2}}. 
Would you like to add any special delivery instructions?
```
