The Handoff Node enables seamless transition from automated agent conversations to human intervention when issues require personal attention or fall outside the agent's capabilities.

### Purpose & Functionality

Immediately stops the agent's execution for the user and prevents further automated message processing for that conversation, setting the status to `handoff`. It does not use a prompt and signals that the conversation requires external intervention (e.g., transfer to a human).

Unlike other nodes, the Handoff Node does not have a prompt configuration since its purpose is to immediately exit automated processing.

### Configuration

- **Name:** A label for the node on the Canvas
- No prompt configuration is necessary or used

### Use Cases

- Escalating complex issues
- Transferring conversations to human support agents
- Handling sensitive requests requiring human judgment
- Managing situations where the agent can't resolve an issue
- Allowing for supervision of specific conversation paths

### Best Practices

- Place Handoff Nodes at strategic points in your Agent Graph where human intervention might be necessary
- Consider using a Default Node before the Handoff Node to explain to the user that they're being transferred
- Create clear edge conditions leading to Handoff Nodes
- Ensure you have a system in place to monitor and handle conversations in "handoff" status
- Document common reasons for handoffs to improve your Agent Graph over time

### Implementation Example

A common implementation pattern is to have a Default Node explain the handoff before transferring:

**Default Node (preceding the Handoff Node):**
```
Inform the customer that for this complex issue, you'll connect them with a specialist 
who can better assist them. Let them know someone will review their conversation 
shortly.
```

**Handoff Node:**
Simply add this node after the explanation node with no additional configuration.
