Special Nodes are the foundational entry and exit points for every Agent Graph. These nodes have specific roles and behaviors that cannot be modified or deleted.

## Start Node

### Purpose & Functionality
The Start Node serves as the entry point for all conversations. Every execution flow begins here.

- It is automatically included in every Agent Graph
- Cannot be deleted
- Always has an "initial" label
- Execution always begins at this node

### Configuration
The Start Node requires no specific configuration.

### Best Practices
- Connect the Start Node to appropriate initial conversation nodes
- Consider different entry points based on conversation channel or context
- For WhatsApp flows, often connect to a WhatsApp Template Node for the first message

## End Node

### Purpose & Functionality
The End Node represents an immediate termination point for a conversation path.

- It is automatically included in every Agent Graph
- Cannot be deleted
- Always has an "end" label
- When reached, execution immediately stops (in contrast to the Warm End Node which allows for a grace period)

### Configuration
The End Node requires no specific configuration.

## Comparison: End Node vs. Warm End Node

| Feature | End Node | Warm End Node |
|---------|----------|---------------|
| Termination | Immediate | After timeout |
| Final Questions | Not allowed | Permitted within timeout |
| Closing Message | Not built-in (requires preceding node) | Configured in prompt |
| Timeout Setting | N/A | Configurable |
| Use Case | Definitive conclusion | Graceful conclusion |
