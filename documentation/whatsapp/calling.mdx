## Get started

### Step 1: Prerequisites

Before you get started with the Calling API, ensure that:

[Your business number is in use with Cloud API](https://developers.facebook.com/documentation/business-messaging/whatsapp/business-phone-numbers/phone-numbers) (not the WhatsApp Business app)
Subscribe your app to the `calls` webhook field (unless you plan to use [SIP](https://developers.facebook.com/documentation/business-messaging/whatsapp/calling/sip))
The same app should also be [subscribed to the WhatsApp Business Account](https://developers.facebook.com/documentation/business-messaging/whatsapp/webhooks/create-webhook-endpoint#configure-webhooks) of your business phone number.
This app should have messaging permissions (`whatsapp_business_messaging`) for the business number
The business must have a messaging limit of at least [2000 business-initiated conversations](https://developers.facebook.com/documentation/business-messaging/whatsapp/messaging-limits) in a rolling 24-hour period. More details on [scaling your account capabilities](https://www.facebook.com/business/help/595597942906808).
[Enable Calling features on your business phone number](https://developers.facebook.com/documentation/business-messaging/whatsapp/calling/call-settings)

### Step 2: Configure optional calling features

The WhatsApp Business Calling API offers a number of features that affect when and how calling features appear to users on your WhatsApp profile

Inbound call control allows you to prevent users from placing calls from your business profile
Business call hours allows you to avoid missed calls and direct users to message when your call center is closed
Callback requests offer users the option to request a callback when you don’t pick up a call or if your call center is closed

[Learn more about call control settings](https://developers.facebook.com/documentation/business-messaging/whatsapp/calling/call-settings#parameter-details)

### Step 3: Make and receive calls

You can test your WhatsApp Calling integration using public test numbers and Sandbox WhatsApp Business Account.

[Learn more about testing your WhatsApp Calling API integration](https://developers.facebook.com/documentation/business-messaging/whatsapp/calling#testing-and-sandbox-accounts)

Cloud API Calling offers two call initiation paths:

**User-initiated calls:** Calls that are made from a WhatsApp user to your business
**Business-initiated calls:** Calls that are made from your business to a WhatsApp user

## Testing and Sandbox accounts

Sandbox accounts are only available to Tech Partners.

[Sandbox accounts](https://developers.facebook.com/documentation/business-messaging/whatsapp/calling/sandbox) and public test numbers enable you to test you WhatsApp Calling API integration with relaxed calling limitations.
Specifically business initiated calling limits are relaxed for Sandbox accounts and public test numbers to help integration and testing efforts.

#### Limits (Per business + WhatsApp user pair)

Sandbox accounts can make **100 connected calls every 24 hours** (vs 10 connected calls every 24 hours for prod accounts)
Sandbox accounts can send **25 call permissions per day** and **100 per week** (vs 1 per day and 2 per week for prod accounts)
When business-initiated calls go unanswered or are rejected
**5 consecutive unanswered calls** result in system message to reconsider an approved permission (vs 2 consecutive unanswered calls for prod accounts)
**10 consecutive unanswered calls** result in an approved permission being automatically revoked. (vs 4 consecutive unanswered calls for prod accounts)

You obtain a public test number after completing the [Get Started flow.](https://developers.facebook.com/documentation/business-messaging/whatsapp/get-started)

You are also not required to have a messaging limit of at least [2000 business-initiated conversations](https://developers.facebook.com/documentation/business-messaging/whatsapp/messaging-limits) in a rolling 24-hour period to test Calling API features when using public test numbers and Sandbox accounts.

Calling is disabled by default on test numbers. You must [configure calling features in phone number call settings](https://developers.facebook.com/documentation/business-messaging/whatsapp/calling/call-settings#configure-call-settings) before using the Calling API on a test number.
