# Upload Inventory to Meta

Updated: Oct 22, 2025

A business’s inventory needs to be uploaded to Meta in a catalog format — see [About Catalogs](https://www.facebook.com/business/help/890714097648074) for more information.

If a business already has a Meta catalog set up, we suggest that you leverage that catalog for WhatsApp commerce use cases. Just [connect the catalog to a WhatsApp Business Account](https://www.facebook.com/business/help/158662536425974) (WABA) and the business will be able to [share products with customers](https://developers.facebook.com/documentation/business-messaging/whatsapp/catalogs/sell-products-and-services/share-products).

If a business needs to create a catalog, there are two possibilities:

Create a catalog using the [Commerce API](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/commerce-platform/catalog/get-started)
Create a catalog using the [Meta Commerce Manager](https://business.facebook.com/commerce/).

You can only upload one catalog per WABA, but the same catalog can belong to multiple phone numbers.

## Solution Partners

Solution Partners onboarding client businesses into commerce messages have the following options:

If a client business already has and manages their own Meta catalog, they can give permission to the Solution Partner to manage their catalog —these permissions are controlled via the [Meta Business Manager](https://business.facebook.com/) and [Meta Commerce Manager](https://business.facebook.com/commerce/). After that, the Solution Partner can [connect the WhatsApp Business Account to the catalog](https://www.facebook.com/business/help/158662536425974) via WhatsApp Manager.
If a client business doesn’t have a Meta catalog, they can create and upload a new catalog under the Solution Partner’s business ID.
