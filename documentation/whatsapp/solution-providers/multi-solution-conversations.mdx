Some features may not be available or work as expected. [Beta terms apply](https://www.facebook.com/legal/BetaProductTestingTerms).

## Overview

## Key features

**Simple end-business onboarding via Embedded Sign-up:** Partners can onboard businesses easily through [Embedded Signup](https://developers.facebook.com/documentation/business-messaging/whatsapp/solution-providers/multi-solution-conversations#onboarding-for-msc--embedded-signup-flow-).
**Payment and template isolation per partner:** Each partner has their own WhatsApp Business Account, their own templates, and their own billing and metrics.

## How Multi-Solution Conversations works

The chart above illustrates a new WABA shared with each integrated partner, and assets separated per WABA.

The business shares all phone numbers associated with their WhatsApp Business Account (WABA) to a partner through the [Embedded Signup flow](https://developers.facebook.com/documentation/business-messaging/whatsapp/solution-providers/multi-solution-conversations#onboarding-for-msc--embedded-signup-flow-).
A new WABA is created and shared with the respective partner that the business onboards with.
The partner now has messaging or calling access to the business phone numbers shared with them and can message or manage calls on behalf of the business.

### Supported APIs and Usage

Businesses can use a single phone number across one or multiple partners across the following APIs and uses:

[Messaging via WhatsApp Cloud API](https://developers.facebook.com/documentation/business-messaging/whatsapp/messages/send-messages)
[Calling via WhatsApp Cloud API](https://developers.facebook.com/documentation/business-messaging/whatsapp/calling)
[Click-to-WhatsApp Ads via Ads Manager](https://www.facebook.com/business/help/447934475640650?id=371525583593535)

**Note:** Direct developers using a partner for any of these use cases is supported with Multi-solution Conversations, **except for MM Lite**.

## Limitations

MM Lite is not supported for MSC businesses. Any [`marketing_messages`](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/whatsapp/marketing-messages-lite-api/sending-messages#send-marketing-template-messages) requests will either be routed via Cloud API or rejected if the `product_policy` filed is set to strict.

**MSC does not currently support:**

Conversation routing and management: currently, all parties the phone number is shared with receive incoming webhooks. Businesses must work with partners to manage response handling.
Coexistence phone numbers
Phone numbers using the Groups API
WABA created through Embedded Signup which are used on Ads Manager for Marketing Messages
[Measurement Partner onboarding](https://developers.facebook.com/documentation/business-messaging/whatsapp/solution-providers/measurement-partners)

### General limitations

Only 5 partners or solutions can be enabled per each end-business WhatsApp Business Account (WABA).
Only 1 partner can attach a catalog to the shared phone number(s) between partners.

### Phone number sharing limitations

The business cannot share a phone number with the same partner more than once via different WABAs.

For example, the business has a phone number linked to WABA 1 and then shares WABA 1 with Partner 1. If you have the same phone number linked to WABA 2, you cannot also share WABA 2 with Partner 1. If you try to share the phone number, you may receive an error.

**Template Violations**
Template violations will only apply to the violating WABA.
**Business Portfolio Violations**
Any bans on the Business Portfolio will ban all WABAs associated with the phone number

[Decision appeals](https://developers.facebook.com/documentation/business-messaging/whatsapp/policy-enforcement#appeals) continue to function as they do today.

## Onboarding for MSC (Embedded Signup flow)

Only available to businesses with a messaging limit of at least 1000 business-initiated conversations in a rolling 24 hour period.

Once a business meets the eligibility requirements, the MSC flow for Embedded Signup is automatically displayed in the Embedded Signup (ES) flow ( [v2 and above](https://developers.facebook.com/documentation/business-messaging/whatsapp/embedded-signup/versions#version-2)). Partners don’t need to configure anything in Embedded Signup for this to work.

This means that when businesses sign-up to a partner through ES, they will automatically be shown the flow below and be given the choice to share their existing business phone numbers which will onboard the business and partner to MSC. ES has two experiences and a given business may see either one of these randomly. Both experiences are described below

Once the business completes the Embedded Signup flow, the partner does not need to re-register with the business again.

## Troubleshooting

**The “Share existing WhatsApp phone numbers” option is greyed out**

This can happen for a couple of possible reasons

The business has already has a solution with the partner they are trying to share the number with
The business has exceed the 5 partner maximum for the number
The phone number is not eligible to send 1k messages yet
The phone number has not been registered

**What can I do if the business phone number goes offline?**

Rarely, a phone number can go offline. To solve this issue, try the following:

**Register the phone number again:** The business should search each of their WABA activity logs to find which partner registered the phone number first. Then, that partner can register the phone number again.
**_(Optional)_ Turn off 2-factor authentication (2FA):** If the business cannot obtain which partner originally registered the phone number, they can shut off 2FA and have another partner register the number again. [Learn how to disable 2FA on a phone number](https://developers.facebook.com/documentation/business-messaging/whatsapp/business-phone-numbers/phone-numbers#disabling-two-step-verification).
