## Contacting support

If you were onboarded to the WhatsApp Business Platform by a solution provider and you have [registered](https://developers.facebook.com/async/registration/) as a Meta developer, you can get help by opening a Direct Support ticket using the **Ask a Question** button at:

## Display names

Once a business phone number’s display name is reviewed, business customers can change their display name using WhatsApp Manager. Newly edited display names must under display name review again.

To edit a display name via WhatsApp Manager:

Access WhatsApp Manager at [https://business.facebook.com/wa/manage/home/](https://business.facebook.com/wa/manage/home/).
Navigate to **Account tools** \> **Phone numbers**.
Click the phone number.
Click the **Profile** tab.
Under **Display name**, use the **Edit** button to submit a new name.

This action, as well as the review outcome, triggers a [phone_number_name_update](https://developers.facebook.com/documentation/business-messaging/whatsapp/webhooks/reference/phone_number_name_update) webhook.

## Unable to send template messages

If you are unable to send template messages, you likely have not added a valid payment method to your account. See our [Add a credit card to your WhatsApp Business Platform account](https://www.facebook.com/business/help/488291839463771) Help Center article to learn now to add a valid payment method.
