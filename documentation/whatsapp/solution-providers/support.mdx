## Troubleshooting

### Onboarded business customers can’t send messages

There may be situations where business customers can’t send messages after completing the Embedded Signup flow. The following checks may help resolve this issue:

Verify that a valid payment method is attached to the WhatsApp Business Account. If there isn’t a payment method attached (either a credit line for business customers onboarded via a Solution Provider, or a credit card for customers onboarded via a Tech Provider or Tech Partner), the customer will be unable to send template messages.
Check if a different business phone number was registered as part of the onboarding process. If this is the case, you must register the problematic number for use with Cloud API.
Check if the WhatsApp Business Account has been disabled. We automatically disable WhatsApp Business Accounts that violate our policies, so this may be the reason.
