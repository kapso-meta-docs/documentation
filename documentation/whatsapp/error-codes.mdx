Error codes
===========

Updated: Nov 19, 2025

The Cloud API is built on the Graph API, so if you are unfamiliar with handling Graph API error responses, see the [Graph API error handling](/docs/graph-api/guides/error-handling) documentation.

In general, we recommend that you build your app’s error handling logic around `code` values and `details` payload properties. These properties and their values are more indicative of the underlying error.

Code titles, which do not have a dedicated property in API error response payloads, are included as part of the `message` value. However, we recommend that you do not rely on titles for your error handling logic as titles will eventually be deprecated.

**Receiving Errors: Synchronous and Asynchronous**

Cloud API errors are returned either synchronously as a Graph API response, asynchronously via Webhook, or sometimes through both methods.

It is a good practice when working with Cloud API that you monitor both the Graph API response and the `messages` webhook for error handling. If you are subscribed to the `messages` webhook field, you will receive notification of errors as they occur for supported asynchronous error types.

Error response webhooks and syntax
----------------------------------

Cloud API errors can be surfaced in the following webhook objects:

*   `entry.changes.value.errors`*   `entry.changes.value.messages.errors`

**Error response syntax**

```json
{
  "error": {  
    "message": "<MESSAGE\>",  
    "type": "<TYPE\>",  
    "code": <CODE\>,  
    "error_data": {  
      "messaging_product": "whatsapp",  
      "details": "<DETAILS\>"  
    },  
    "error_subcode": <ERROR\_SUBCODE\>,  
    "fbtrace_id": "<FBTRACE\_ID\>"  
  }  
}
```

Error response contents
-----------------------

Property

Value Type

Description

`code`

Integer

[Error code](#error-codes). We recommend that you build your app’s error handling around error codes instead of subcodes or HTTP response status codes.

`details`

String

Error description and a description of the most likely reason for the error. May also contain information on how to address the error, such as which parameter is invalid or what values are acceptable.

`error_subcode`

Integer

**Deprecated. Will not be returned in v16.0+ responses.**

  
Graph API subcode. Not all responses will include a subcode, so we recommend that you build your error handling logic around `code` and `details` properties instead.

`fbtrace_id`

String

Trace ID you can include when contacting [Direct Support](https://business.facebook.com/direct-support). The ID may help us debug the error.

`message`

String

Combination of the error code and its title. For example: `(#130429) Rate limit hit`.

`messaging_product`

String

Messaging product. This will always be the string `whatsapp` for Cloud API responses.

`type`

String

Error type.

Example response
----------------

```json
{
  "error": {  
    "message": "(#130429) Rate limit hit",  
    "type": "OAuthException",  
    "code": 130429,  
    "error_data": {  
        "messaging_product": "whatsapp",  
        "details": "Cloud API message throughput has been reached."  
    },  
    "error_subcode": 2494055,  
    "fbtrace_id": "Az8or2yhqkZfEZ-\_4Qn\_Bam"  
  }  
}

If you receive an error indicating that the onboarding request has already been made, no further action is required, as all eligible WABAs for that client will be onboarded without additional steps.
