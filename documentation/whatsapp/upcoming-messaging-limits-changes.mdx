# Upcoming changes to messaging limits

Updated: Oct 26, 2025

The changes described in this document are now live, and are only here for reference purposes. Our [Messaging limits](https://developers.facebook.com/documentation/business-messaging/whatsapp/messaging-limits) document has been updated to reflect these changes.

Messaging limits are currently calculated and set on a per-number basis. **Starting October 7, 2025**, messaging limits will instead be calculated and set on a business portfolio basis, and will be shared by all business phone numbers within each portfolio.

Existing business portfolios will have their messaging limit set to the highest limit of any phone number within their portfolio (e.g. if a portfolio has a phone number with a limit of 100K and other phone numbers with lower limits, the portfolio’s limit will be set to 100K).

These changes will result in:

**Faster access to higher limits**, with upgrades within 6 hours (compared to the current 24 hours) and immediate access to the portfolio’s limits for newly registered numbers.
**Greater flexibility**, allowing you to have as many phones as needed without requiring additional phones to access higher limits, since all phones share the portfolio’s limit.
**Reduced administrative burden and operational costs**, by minimizing the need for unnecessary phone numbers.
