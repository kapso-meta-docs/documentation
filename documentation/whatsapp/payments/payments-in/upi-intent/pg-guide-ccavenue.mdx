# CCAvenue Payment Gateway Integration Guide

Updated: Dec 10, 2025

The purpose of this document is to lay down the payment integration with CCAvenue that is required for a merchant (or BSP) that has implemented a chatbot using WhatsApp Business APIs and needs to accept payments from WhatsApp users.

This document outlines the necessary APIs that must be integrated and how the integration works in conjunction with the WhatsApp Business API integration. While not a comprehensive guide, it serves as a general overview to assist in understanding the payment gateway integration process. Any specific or unique details related to the payment gateway must be determined by the merchant (or BSP).

In terms of integrating with the WA P2M product, this document covers the requests and responses highlighted in red within the flow diagram.

## CCAvenue integration with WhatsApp Payments

### Setup

Please use documentation from CCAVenue for steps to authenticate with their server.

To simplify the explanation, the following examples will only address the body of the final payload that will ultimately be included in the final object required for successful authentication with their API. It is important to consult CCAvenue’s documentation for guidance on how this final object must be structured.

You must have the following details before you can proceed:

Successfully authenticate
Details from the payment configuration you already configured on the WhatsApp Business Account.
Merchant category code
Merchant’s VPA

}
```

#### Decrypted Sample Response

```
\{
     "errorCode":"",
     "errorMessage":"",
     "intentUrl":"upi://pay?pa=vpa@samplebank&pn=Infibeam Avenues Limited&tr=123123123123&am=100.0&cu=INR&mc=8299"
 }
```

#### Parse the response

Use the value of `intentUrl` in the response and pass it as the `upi_intent_link` while setting up the [`parameters` object to send for the order details message using the WhatsApp API](https://developers.facebook.com/documentation/business-messaging/whatsapp/payments/payments-in/upi-intent/dynamic-vpa#paymentsettingsobject).

### Status webhook

When an event occurs, such as the successful processing of a payment in your CCAvenue account, CCAvenue generates an event object. This event object contains essential details, including the event type and associated data. CCAvenue forwards this event object to a designated URL in your account’s webhook settings through an HTTP POST request.

### Payment status

Use the webhook notification above to find the payment status using the **Payment status API**.

#### Request

Sample payload to `POST` to `https://api.ccavenue.com/apis/servlet/DoWebTrans`

```
\{
  "orderNo": "11111111",
  "referenceNo": "111111111111"
}
```

#### Parse the response

Utilize the `order_status` retrieved from the response above and transmit the corresponding [status message](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/whatsapp/cloud-api/payments-api/upi#step-7--update-order-status) via WhatsApp API.
