# Receive UPI Payments Through WhatsApp(Recommended)

Updated: Nov 14, 2025

For businesses working with Razorpay or PayU payment gateways, we have deeper integration with these PGs. Please refer to [Payment Gateway Integration Guide](https://developers.facebook.com/documentation/business-messaging/whatsapp/payments/payments-in/pg)

Your business can enable customers to pay for their orders using all the UPI Apps installed on their devices via WhatsApp. Businesses can send customers invoice (`order_details`) messages, then get notified about payment status updates via webhook notifications from Payment Gateway.

## Overview

Currently, customers browse business catalogs, add products to cart, and send orders in with our set of commerce messaging solutions, which includes [Single Product Message, Multi Product Message, and Product Detail Page](https://developers.facebook.com/documentation/business-messaging/whatsapp/catalogs/sell-products-and-services/share-products).

With the WhatsApp Payments API, businesses can send customers a bill so the customer can complete their order with all the UPI Apps.

## How It Works

The business must send an `order_details` message for the consumer to initiate payment. This type of message is a new type of interactive message, which always contains the same 4 main components: **header**, **body**, **footer**, and **action**. Inside the **action** component, the business includes all the information needed for the customer to complete their payment.

An order_details message contains the following fields that are worth noting:

`upi_intent_link` \- Fields that will be supplied by your payment gateway and denote where a payment will be sent.
`reference_id` \- This is used to track the lifecycle of the order. Payment statuses are published against this ID. This could be order-id or transaction-id used to create the upi-intent at payment gateway.

Once the message is sent, the business waits for a payment or transaction status updates directly from Payment Gateway. Upon receiving payment signal for an order, Business should relay this payment signal to consumer through interactive order status (`order_status`) message.

Updating users about the payment signal is important as this message updates the order details message and order details view for the consumer reflecting the order confirmation from the merchant. This is shown with an example in subsequent sections.

## Purchase Flow in App

In the WhatsApp customer app, the purchase flow has the following steps:

Customer sends an order with selected products to the business, or the business identifies the products that the customer has shown interest to purchase.

After receiving the order/identifying the product, if a merchant accepts payment methods other than UPI, such as credit cards and payment wallets, then the merchant will send a message to the user to get their preferred payment method for the order.

When consumers want to pay using UPI payment method, then merchants should retrieve the UPI payment intent by calling Payment Gateway. Merchant needs to use UPI intent to construct order details messages and send it to the consumer.

When the consumer taps the Pay now/continue button, they will be given the option to choose UPI payment Apps - WhatsApp or any other UPI payments apps. Consumers may choose any UPI option to pay for the order.

Consumer pays for the order and the payment method is saved for the future and automatically selected for the next payment transaction. Also, one quick note is the order details screen order-status will continue to show “Order pending” until the merchant sends order status interactive message.

Once the payment is complete, the business receives a notification from Payment Gateway and the merchant needs to send order status updates to the consumer client notifying consumers about the progress to the order, this will update the order details message CTAs and order details screen - order status description.

## Integration Steps

The steps outlined below assume that the business is about to send order details message to the consumer client.

The following sequence diagram demonstrates the typical integration flow for WA Payments API:

### Step 1: Get UPI Intent from Payment Gateway

Once the consumer has expressed their interest to purchase an item using UPI payment method, merchant needs to call payment gateway to create a UPI intent, the following is the sample UPI intent link:

```
upi://pay?pa=abc@psp&pn=ABC&tr=877376394&
  am=10.00&cu=INR&mode=00&purpose=00&mc=5399&tn=877376394
```

Merchant/Partner could send the entire UPI intent as it is in the `upi_intent_link` type payload. These will be discussed in detail below.

### Step 2: Assemble the Interactive Object

To send an `order_details` message, businesses must assemble an [interactive object](https://developers.facebook.com/documentation/business-messaging/whatsapp/reference/whatsapp-business-phone-number/message-api#interactive-object) of type `order_details` with the following components:

| Object | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `type`<br />object | **Required.**<br />Must be “order_details”. |
| `header`<br />object | **Optional.**<br />Header content displayed on top of a message. If a header is not provided, the API uses an image of the first available product as the header |
| `body`<br />object | **Required.**<br />An object with the body of the message. The object contains the following field:<br />`text` string<br />**Required** if `body` is present. The content of the message. Emojis and markdown are supported. Maximum length is 1024 characters |

        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### Step 3: Add Common Message Parameters

Once the interactive object is complete, append the other parameters that make a message: `recipient_type`, `to`, and `type`. Remember to set the `type` to `interactive`.

```
\{
   "messaging_product": "whatsapp",
   "recipient_type": "individual",
   "to": "PHONE_NUMBER",
   "type": "interactive",
   "interactive": {
     // interactive object here
   }
 }
```

These are [parameters common to all message types](https://developers.facebook.com/documentation/business-messaging/whatsapp/messages/send-messages#requests).

### Step 4:Make a POST Call to Messages Endpoint

Make a POST call to the [`/[PHONE_NUMBER_ID]/messages`](https://developers.facebook.com/documentation/business-messaging/whatsapp/reference/whatsapp-business-phone-number/message-api) endpoint with the `JSON` object you have assembled. If your message is sent successfully, you get the following response:

```
\{
  "messaging_product": "whatsapp",
  "contacts": [ {\
      "input": "[PHONE_NUMBER_ID]",\
      "wa_id": "[PHONE-NUMBER_ID]"\
  } ],
  "messages": [ {\
      "id": "wamid.HBgLMTY1MDUwNzY1MjAVAgARGBI5QTNDQTVCM0Q0Q0Q2RTY3RTcA"\
  } ]
}
```

### Step 5: Consumer Pays for the Order

Consumers can pay using WhatsApp payment method or using any UPI supported app that is installed on the device.

### Step 6: Get Notified About Transaction Status Updates from payment gateway

Businesses receive updates to the invoice via payment gateway webhooks, when the status of the user-initiated transaction changes. The unique identifier reference-id passed in `order_details` message can be used to map the transaction to the consumer invoice or interactive order details message.

Please refer to our PG integration guide for the exact payment signals. [Cashfree](https://developers.facebook.com/documentation/business-messaging/whatsapp/payments/payments-in/upi-intent/pg-guide-cashfree) and [CCAvenue](https://developers.facebook.com/documentation/business-messaging/whatsapp/payments/payments-in/upi-intent/pg-guide-cashfree)

### Step 7: Update order status

Upon receiving transaction signals from payment gateway through webhook, the business must update the order status to keep the user up to date. Currently we support the following order status values:

![Image](https://scontent-fra5-2.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.2365-6/565718019_1339318281260156_7557207642198018127_n.jpg?_nc_cat=106&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=e280be&_nc_ohc=v6z8W2paqfcQ7kNvwFeyNps&_nc_oc=AdkFDACYnI8ss5rbTWDZlh3Loz7BnLoRi_190dj_Vbt4LwUJGWdLz0i-Del1iTxnmjM&_nc_zt=14&_nc_ht=scontent-fra5-2.xx&_nc_gid=SZ3nykZw05IetbZP2NBDow&oh=00_AfkdAw5eDZiERFSe4DT-ygIGrZSTkqzV2NG_h34W-Y_-1A&oe=695506F5)

| Value | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `pending` | User has not successfully paid yet |
| `processing` | User payment authorized, merchant/partner is fulfilling the order, performing service, etc. |
| `partially-shipped` | A portion of the products in the order have been shipped by the merchant |
| `shipped` | All the products in the order have been shipped by the merchant |
| `completed` | The order is completed and no further action is expected from the user or the partner/merchant |
| `canceled` | The partner/merchant would like to cancel the `order_details` message for the order/invoice. The status update will fail if there is already a `successful` or `pending` payment for this `order_details` message |

Typically businesses update the `order_status` using either the WhatsApp payment status change notifications or their own internal processes. To update `order_status`, the partner sends a `order_status` message to the user.

```
\{
  "recipient_type": "individual",
  "to": "whatsapp-id",
  "type": "interactive",
  "interactive": {
    "type": "order_status",
    "body": {
      "text": "your-text-body-content"
    },
    "action": {
      "name": "review_order",
      "parameters": {
        "reference_id": "reference-id-value",
        "order": {
          "status": "processing | partially_shipped | shipped | completed | canceled",
          "description": "optional-text"
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

The following table describes the returned values:

| Value | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `reference_id` | The ID provided by the partner in the `order_details` message |
| `status` | The new order `status` |
| `description` | Optional text for sharing status related information in `order_details`. Could be useful while sending cancellation. Max character limit is 120 characters |

Merchant should always post this order-status message to the consumer after receiving transaction updates for an order. As the order_details message and order details screen experience is tied to to the order status updates.

## Security Considerations

Businesses should comply with local security and regulatory requirements in India. They should not rely solely on the status of the transaction provided in the webhook and must use payment lookup API to retrieve the statuses directly from WhatsApp. Businesses must always sanitize/validate the data in the API responses or webhooks to protect against SSRF attacks.

## Checklist for Integrated Merchants

Ensure that an `order_status` message is send to consumer informing them about updates to an order after receiving transaction updates for an order.

Ensure the merchant is verified and WABA contact is marked with a verified check.

Verify the WABA is mapped to appropriate merchant initiated messaging tier(1k, 10k and 100k per day)

Merchant should list the customer support information in the profile screen in case the consumer wants to report any issues.
