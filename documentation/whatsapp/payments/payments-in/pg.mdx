# Receive payments via payment gateways on WhatsApp

Updated: Nov 25, 2025

Your business can enable customers to pay for their orders through our partner payment gateways without leaving WhatsApp. Businesses can send customers order_details messages, then get notified about payment status updates via webhook notifications.

## Overview

Currently, customers browse business catalogs, add products to cart, and send orders with our set of commerce messaging solutions, which includes [Single Product Message, Multi Product Message, and Product Detail Page](https://developers.facebook.com/documentation/business-messaging/whatsapp/catalogs/sell-products-and-services/share-products). Now, with the Payments API, businesses can send customers a _bill_, so the customer can complete their order by paying the business without having to leave WhatsApp.

Our payments solution is currently enabled by BillDesk, Razorpay, PayU and Zaakpay, a third-party payments service provider. You must have a BillDesk, Razorpay, PayU or Zaakpay account in order to receive payments on WhatsApp.

We expect more payment providers to be added in the future.

## How it works

First, the business composes and sends an `order_details` message. An `order_details` message is a new type of `interactive` message, which always contains the same 4 main components: **header**, **body**, **footer**, and **action**. Inside the `action` component, the business includes all the information needed for the customer to complete their payment.

Each `order_details` message contains a unique `reference_id` provided by the business, and that unique ID is used throughout the flow to track the order.

Once the message is sent, the business waits for a payment status update via webhooks. Businesses get notified when the payment status changes, but they must not solely rely on these webhooks notifications due to security reasons. WhatsApp also provides a payment lookup API that can be used to retrieve the payment statuses directly anytime.

## Purchase flow in app

In the WhatsApp Messenger App, the purchase flow has the following steps:

Customers send an order with selected products to the business either through simple text messages or using other interactive messages such as [Single Product Message, Multi Product Message, and Product Detail.](https://developers.facebook.com/documentation/business-messaging/whatsapp/catalogs/sell-products-and-services/share-products)

Once the business receives the order, they send an `order_details` message to the user. When the user taps on **Review and Pay**, they will see details about the order and total amount to be paid.

When the user taps the **Continue** button, they are able to choose to pay natively on WhatsApp or any other UPI app.

Once the payment has been confirmed by your payment gateway (PG) or payment service provider, the business can start processing the order.

Businesses can then send an `order_status` message to the consumer informing them about the status of the order. Each message will result in a message bubble (as shown below) that refers to the original order details message and also updates the status displayed on the order details page.

## Link your payment account

To receive payments on WhatsApp, you must add a _payment configuration_ to the corresponding WhatsApp Business Account. A payment configuration allows you to link a payment gateway account to WhatsApp. Each payment configuration is associated with a _unique name_. As part of the `order_details` message, you can specify the payment configuration to use for a specific checkout. WhatsApp will then generate a checkout flow using the associated payment gateway account.

After linking your payment partner account, you must integrate with the Payments APIs below. This will allow you to send an `order_details` message to customers with the payment configuration to receive payments.

### Steps to unlink Payment Configuration

Note: Make sure no new order messages requesting payment from consumer are sent with the payment config your are trying to remove before you perform the unlink action.

## Integration Steps

The steps outlined below assume that the business already knows what the user is interested in through earlier chat threads. The Payments API is a standalone API and hence can work with various messages such as [List Messages, Reply Buttons, Single or Multi-Product Messages](https://developers.facebook.com/documentation/business-messaging/whatsapp/reference/whatsapp-business-phone-number/message-api).

          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### Step 2: Add Common Message Parameters

Once the interactive object is complete, append the other parameters that make a message: `recipient_type`, `to`, and `type`. Remember to set the `type` to `interactive`.

```
\{
   "messaging_product": "whatsapp",
   "recipient_type": "individual",
   "to": "PHONE_NUMBER",
   "type": "interactive",
   "interactive": {
     // interactive object here
   }
 }
```

These are [parameters common to all message types](https://developers.facebook.com/documentation/business-messaging/whatsapp/messages/send-messages#requests).

### Step 3:Make a POST Call to Messages Endpoint

Make a POST call to the [`/[PHONE_NUMBER_ID]/messages`](https://developers.facebook.com/documentation/business-messaging/whatsapp/reference/whatsapp-business-phone-number/message-api) endpoint with the `JSON` object you have assembled. If your message is sent successfully, you get the following response:

```
\{
  "messaging_product": "whatsapp",
  "contacts": [ {\
      "input": "[PHONE_NUMBER_ID]",\
      "wa_id": "[PHONE_NUMBER_ID]"\
  } ],
  "messages": [ {\
      "id": "wamid.HBgLMTY1MDUwNzY1MjAVAgARGBI5QTNDQTVCM0Q0Q0Q2RTY3RTcA"\
  } ]
}
```

For all errors that can be returned and guidance on how to handle them, see [WhatsApp Cloud API, Error Codes](https://developers.facebook.com/documentation/business-messaging/whatsapp/support/error-codes).

#### Product Experience

The customer receives an `order_details` message similar to the one below (left). When they click on “Review and Pay”, it opens up the order details screen as shown below (middle). Customer can then pay for their order using “Continue” button that opens up a bottom sheet with the payment options (right).

    }]\
  }]
}
```

### Step 5: Confirm Payment

After receiving the payment status webhook, or at any time, the business can look up the status of the payment for the order. To do that, businesses must make a GET call to the payments endpoint as shown here:

```
GET &lt;PHONE_NUMBER_ID&gt;/payments/&lt;PAYMENT_CONFIGURATION&gt;/&lt;REFERENCE_ID&gt;
```

where `payment_configuration` and `reference_id` are same as that sent in the `order_details` message.

Businesses should expect a response in the same HTTP session (not in a webhook notification) that contains the following fields:

| Field | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `reference_id`<br />string | **Required.**<br />The ID sent by the business in the `order_details` message |

#### Payment Status

| Status | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `pending` | The user started the payment process and the payment object was created |
| `captured` | The payment was captured |

An example successful response looks like this:

```
\{
  "payments": [{\
    "reference_id": "reference-id-value",\
    "status": "status-of-payment",\
    "currency": "INR",\
    "total_amount": {\
      "value": 21000,\
      "offset": 100\
    },\
    "transactions": [\
      {\
        "id": "[PG-ORDER-ID]",\
        "pg_transaction_id": "[PG-TXN-ID]",\
        "type": "billdesk/razorpay/payu/zaakpay",\
        "status": "success/failed",\
        "created_timestamp": "CREATED_TIMESTAMP",\
        "updated_timestamp": "UPDATED_TIMESTAMP",\
        "method": {\
           "type": "upi/card/netbanking/wallet"\
        },\
        "error": {\
           "code": "pg-generated-error-code",\
           "reason": "pg-generated-descriptive-reason"\
        },\
        "refunds": [\
          {\
            "id": "[REFUND-ID]",\
            "amount": {\
              "value": 100,\
              "offset": 100\
            },\
            "speed_processed": "instant/normal",\
            "status": "success",\
            "created_timestamp": "CREATED_TIMESTAMP",\
            "updated_timestamp": "UPDATED_TIMESATMP",\
          }\
        ],\
      }\
    ],\
    "receipt": "receipt-value",\
    "notes": {\
      "key1": "value1",\
      "key2": "value2"\
    },\
    "udf1": "udf1-value",\
    "udf2": "udf2-value",\
    "udf3": "udf3-value",\
    "udf4": "udf4-value"\
    "additional_info1": "additional_info1-value",\
    "additional_info2": "additional_info2-value",\
    "additional_info3": "additional_info3-value",\
    "additional_info4": "additional_info4-value",\
    "additional_info5": "additional_info5-value",\
    "additional_info6": "additional_info6-value",\
    "additional_info7": "additional_info7-value",\
  }]
}
```

In the case of any errors, response is similar to an error response for `/v1/messages` endpoint. For all errors that can be returned and guidance on how to handle them, see [WhatsApp On-Premises API, Errors](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/whatsapp/on-premises/errors). Show here is an example for a generic error:

```
\{
  "errors": [{\
    "code": 500,\
    "title": "Generic error",\
    "details": "System error. Please try again."\
  }]
}
```

### Step 6: Update Order Status

Businesses _must_ send updates to their order using the `order_status` message instead of text messages since the latest status of an order displayed on the order details page is only based on `order_status` messages.

To notify the customer with updates to an order, you can send an `interactive` message of type `order_status` as shown below.

```
\{
  "recipient_type": "individual",
  "to": "whatsapp-id",
  "type": "interactive",
  "interactive": {
    "type": "order_status",
    "body": {
      "text": "your-text-body-content"
    },
    "action": {
      "name": "review_order",
      "parameters": {
        "reference_id": "reference-id-value",
        "order": {
          "status": "processing | partially_shipped | shipped | completed | canceled",
          "description": "optional-text"
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

The following table describes the fields in the `order_status` interactive message:

| Object | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `type`<br />string | **Required.**<br />Must be “order_status” |
| `body`<br />object | **Required.**<br />An object with the body of the message. The object contains the following field:<br />`text` string<br />**Required** if `body` is present. The content of the message. Emojis and markdown are supported. Maximum length is 1024 characters |
| `footer`<br />object | **Optional.**<br />An object with the footer of the message. The object contains the following field:<br />`text` string<br />**Required** if `footer` is present. The footer content. Emojis, markdown, and links are supported. Maximum length is 60 characters |
| `action`<br />object | **Required.**<br />An action object you want the user to perform after reading the message. This action object contains the following fields:<br />`name` string<br />**Required**. Must be “review_order”.<br />`parameters` object<br />See [Parameters Object](https://developers.facebook.com/documentation/business-messaging/whatsapp/payments/payments-in/pg#paramobject-orderstatus) for information |

The `parameters` object contains the following fields:

| Value | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `reference_id`<br />string | **Required.**<br />The ID sent by the business in the `order_details` message |
| `order`<br />object | **Required.**<br />This object contains the following fields:<br />`status` string<br />**Required.** The new order `status`. Must be one of `processing`, `partially_shipped`, `shipped`, `completed`, `canceled`.<br />`description` string<br />**Optional.** Text for sharing status related information in `order_details`. Could be useful while sending cancellation. Max character limit is 120 characters. |

`order_status` message introduces two new errors that are summarized below.

| Error Code | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `2046` \- Invalid status transition | The order status transition is not allowed. More details [here](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/whatsapp/on-premises/payments-api/p2m-lite#valid-order-status-transition). |
| `2047` \- Cannot cancel order | Cannot cancel the order since the user has already paid for it. More details [here](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/whatsapp/on-premises/payments-api/p2m-lite#canceling-order). |

For all other errors that can be returned and guidance on how to handle them, see [WhatsApp On-Premises API, Errors](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/whatsapp/on-premises/errors).

#### Product Experience

Customers receive each `order_status` update as a separate message in their chat thread, that references their original `order_details` message as shown below (left). The order details page always displays the latest valid status communicated to the customer using the `order_status` message as shown below (right).

#### Supported Order Status and Transitions

Currently we support the following order status values:

| Value | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `pending` | User has not successfully paid yet |
| `processing` | User payment authorized, merchant/partner is fulfilling the order, performing service, etc. |
| `partially-shipped` | A portion of the products in the order have been shipped by the merchant |
| `shipped` | All the products in the order have been shipped by the merchant |
| `completed` | The order is completed and no further action is expected from the user or the partner/merchant |
| `canceled` | The partner/merchant would like to cancel the `order_details` message for the order/invoice. The status update will fail if there is already a `successful` or `pending` payment for this `order_details` message |

Order status transitions are restricted for consistency of consumer experience. Allowed status transitions are summarized below:

Initial status of an order is always `pending`, which is sent in `order_details` message.
`canceled` and `completed` are terminal status and cannot be updated to any other status.
`pending` can transition to any of the other statuses including `processing`, `shipped`, `partially-shipped`.
`processing`, `shipped` and `partially-shipped` are equivalent statuses and can transition between one another or to one of the terminal statuses.

![Image](https://scontent-fra3-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.2365-6/564186195_1339318097926841_2291536531212610046_n.jpg?_nc_cat=108&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=e280be&_nc_ohc=nmOn8Via4L4Q7kNvwH-Ghmg&_nc_oc=AdmUhImGtcDN1vJkIKnp_jkn_5adRdaf_5KJIu6esHVGCT28FxoQ0CyBlnAuEh-feN4&_nc_zt=14&_nc_ht=scontent-fra3-1.xx&_nc_gid=PvDFOgTUjPPJM4R1THs3IA&oh=00_AflNEXTLQSqgjy65W5b6yfF5gcennM2W6YuINwT9Y97Y_A&oe=69550E6D)

Upon sending an `order_status` message with an invalid transition, you will receive an error webhook with the error code `2046` and message “New order status was not correctly transitioned.”

#### Canceling an Order

An order can be `canceled` by sending an `order_status` message with the status `canceled`. The customer cannot pay for an order that is canceled. The customer receives an `order_status` message and order details page is updated to show that the order is canceled and the “Continue” button removed. The _optional_ text shown below “Order canceled” on the order details page can be specified using the `description` field in the `order_status` message.

An order can be canceled only if the user has not already paid for the order. If the user has paid and you send an `order_status` message with `canceled` status, you will receive an error webhook with error code `2047` and message “Could not change order status to ‘canceled’”.

### Step 7: Reconcile Payments

WhatsApp does not support payment reconciliations. Businesses should use their payment gateway account to reconcile the payments using the `reference_id` provided in the `order_details` messages and the `id` of the transactions returned as part of the payment lookup query.

### Step 8: Refunds

Business can initiate a refund for an order. To do that, businesses must make a POST call to the `/[PHONE_NUMBER_ID]/payments_refund` endpoint with the following `JSON` object:

```
\{
  "reference_id": "reference-id-value",
  "speed": "normal",
  "payment_config_id": "payment-config-id",
  "amount": {
    "currency": "INR",
    "value": "100",
    "offset": "100"
  }
}
```

The following table describes the fields in the refunds endpoint request object:

| Field | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `reference_id`<br />string | **Required.**<br />Unique reference ID for the order sent in `order_details` message. |
| `speed`<br />string | **Optional.**<br />Speed by which refund should be processed. Can be one of `instant` or `normal`. |
| `payment_config_id`<br />string | **Required.**<br />Payment configuration for the order sent in `order_details` message. |
| `amount`<br />object | **Required.**<br />The `amount` object contains the following fields:<br />`offset` string<br />**Required.** Must be `100` for `INR`.<br />`value` string<br />**Required.** Positive integer representing the amount value multiplied by offset. For example, ₹12.34 has value 1234.<br />`currency` string<br />**Required.** The currency for this refund. Currently the only supported value is INR. |

Businesses should expect a response in the same HTTP session (not in a webhook notification) that contains the following fields:

| Field | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `id`<br />string | **Required.**<br />A unique ID representing the initiated refund. |
| `status`<br />string | **Required.**<br />Status of the refund. Can be one of `pending`, `failed` or `completed` |
| `speed_processed`<br />string | **Required.**<br />Speed by which refund was processed. Can be one of `instant` or `normal`. PGs are the ultimate arbitrator of which speed mode refund goes through. This might NOT always match what was included in the request parameters. |

An example successful response looks like this:

```
\{
  "id": "refund-id",
  "status": "pending",
  "speed_processed": "normal"
}
```

## Merchant Preferred UPI Payment Method

Now merchants can specify up to one UPI Payment app to showup in checkout flow. Merchant preferred payment app will be shown on top of the list of available UPI apps in the “Choose payment method” screen. To enable this capability we require partners to specify the external app-id in the Order Details or order-invoice message.

Note: This feature is available on consumer apps on and above version: 2.24.21.0

## Restrict Available Payment Options

Merchants can specify which payment options to show in checkout flow between UPI and Web options. This will allow merchants to enable only UPI or credit card(any PG available option) to accept payments for invoices.

Note: This feature is available on consumer apps on and above version: 2.24.22.4

### Updates to Order Details Payload

```
\{
  "messaging_product": "whatsapp",
  "interactive": {
    "action": {
      "name": "review_and_pay",
      "parameters": {
        "payment_settings": [\

           }\
        ],
      "order": ...
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### List of payment options

| Enabled Option | Experience in checkout flow |
| --- | --- |
| upi | Only UPI apps are show in checkout flow |

Some Payment Gateways allow customization of payment options that are shown in payment link or web based checkout flow. Please contact Payment Gateway to restricting payment options in payment link or web page.

## Third Party Validation with Razorpay and PayU Payment Gateways

We now support TPV for RazorPay and PayU merchants, this allows merchants to specify the consumer accounts from which orders needs to be paid. Since, the consumer bank account information is sensitive, please work with Payment Gateways to procure public encryption key and pass the encryption information as part of Order details message.

To use this feature which is in alpha testing, please reach out to Meta payments team - whatsappindia-bizpayments-support@meta.com

### Updates to Order Details Payload to support TPV for Razorpay merchants

```
\{
  "messaging_product": "whatsapp",
  "interactive": {
    "action": {
      "name": "review_and_pay",
      "parameters": {
        "payment_settings": [\
          {\
            "type": "razorpay",\
            "razorpay": {\
              "encrypted_payment_gateway_data": "encrypted-data"\
            }\
          }\
        ],
        "order": {}
      }
    }
  }
}
```

The raw value before encryption should look something like the following:

```
\{
  "bank_account": {
    "account_number": "account-no",
    "name": "consumer-cbs-name",
    "ifsc": "ifsc-code"
  }
}
```

### Updates to Order Details Payload to support TPV for PayU merchants

```
\{
  "messaging_product": "whatsapp",
  "interactive": {
    "action": {
      "name": "review_and_pay",
      "parameters": {
        "payment_settings": [\
          {\
            "type": "payu",\
            "payu": {\
              "encrypted_payment_gateway_data": "encrypted-data"\
            }\
          }\
        ],
        "order": {}
      }
    }
  }
}
```

The raw value before encryption should look like the following:

```
\{
  "beneficiaryDetail" : {
    "beneficiaryAccountNumber" : "account_number1|account_number2",
    "ifscCode" : "ifsc1|ifsc2",
  }
}
```

Note please closely work with Meta and Payment Gateway teams(RazorPay or PayU) to unlock this feature as we are still in alpha testing phase.

## Security Considerations

Businesses should comply with local security and regulatory requirements in India. They should not rely solely on the status of the transaction provided in the webhook and must use payment lookup API to retrieve the statuses directly from WhatsApp. Businesses must always sanitize/validate the data in the API responses or webhooks to protect against SSRF attacks.

## Checklist for Integrated Merchants

Ensure that `order_status` message is send to consumer informing them about updates to an order after receiving transaction updates for an order.

Ensure the merchant is verified and WABA contact is marked with a verified check.

Verify the WABA is mapped to appropriate merchant initiated messaging tier(1k, 10k and 100k per day)
