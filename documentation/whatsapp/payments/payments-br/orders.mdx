# Orders

Updated: Nov 14, 2025

Payments API introduces two new types of [interactive messages](https://developers.facebook.com/documentation/business-messaging/whatsapp/messages/send-messages#interactive-messages): `order_details` and `order_status`. They are the entrypoint to collect payment in WhatsApp.

`order_details` messages are sent to create an order in the buyer’s WhatsApp client app. This message includes a list of the items being purchased, any fees being charged, and the payment settings used to collect payment. The payment settings will vary depending on the integration type ( [Pix](https://developers.facebook.com/documentation/business-messaging/whatsapp/payments/payments-br/offsite-pix), [payment links](https://developers.facebook.com/documentation/business-messaging/whatsapp/payments/payments-br/payment-links), [Boleto](https://developers.facebook.com/documentation/business-messaging/whatsapp/payments/payments-br/boleto)).
`order_status` messages are sent when businesses update the order status either based on the WhatsApp payment status change notification or based on their internal processes.

Orders start in `pending` status. When the merchant has fully fulfilled the order and the buyer should not expect any further updates, it must be marked as `completed`.

## Sending order messages

Both message types contain the same 4 main components of an interactive message: _header_, _body_, _footer_, and _action_. The parameters in the _action_ component will vary based on the message type.

Once the interactive message object is assembled, make a POST call to the [messages endpoint](https://developers.facebook.com/documentation/business-messaging/whatsapp/reference/whatsapp-business-phone-number/message-api#messages). Remember to set the type to `interactive`.
