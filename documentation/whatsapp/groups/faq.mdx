### What happens when I delete a group?

No members, including you, will be able to message the group.
If any messages or statuses were received by Cloud API before the group was deleted, you may still receive webhooks for those.

### Why can’t a participant join the group using my invite link?

Some possible reasons include:

The invite link may have been deleted.
You may have removed the participant from the group previously.
The group may already be full.

### How can I send my invite link to users?

You can send the invite link over a 1:1 conversation.
A new utility template is available in the [Template Library](https://business.facebook.com/wa/manage/template-library) to [send group invite links](https://developers.facebook.com/documentation/business-messaging/whatsapp/groups/reference#send-group-invite-link-template-message).
