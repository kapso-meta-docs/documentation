Delivered voice messages appear in the WhatsApp client with a play icon, waveform graphic, profile image, and a microphone icon.

## October 8, 2025

_Cloud API, Business Management API_

[Messaging limits](https://developers.facebook.com/documentation/business-messaging/whatsapp/messaging-limits) are now business portfolio-based instead of business phone number-based, and the initial increase via scaling path is now 2,000 instead of 1,000. To support this change, for version 24.0 and newer requests, a new `whatsapp_business_manager_messaging_limit` field has been added, which returns the owning business portfolio’s messaging limit. This field is available on the following endpoints:

[GET /&lt;BUSINESS_PORTFOLIO_ID&gt;](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/marketing-api/reference/business#Reading)
[GET /&lt;WHATSAPP_BUSINESS_ACCOUNT_ID&gt;](https://developers.facebook.com/documentation/business-messaging/whatsapp/reference/whatsapp-business-account/whatsapp-business-account-api#Reading)

For version 24.0 and newer requests, the `messaging_limit_tier` on the [GET /&lt;BUSINESS_PHONE_NUMBER_ID&gt;](https://developers.facebook.com/documentation/business-messaging/whatsapp/reference/whatsapp-business-phone-number/whatsapp-business-account-phone-number-api#Reading) endpoint now returns the owning business portfolio’s messaging limit.
For version 24.0 and newer requests, added error code `131059` which is returned when querying the [GET /&lt;WHATSAPP_BUSINESS_ACCOUNT_ID&gt;/message_templates](https://developers.facebook.com/documentation/business-messaging/whatsapp/reference/whatsapp-business-account/template-api#Reading) endpoint with an invalid [pagination cursor](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/graph-api/results#cursors). If you get this error, retry your request without `before` or `after` cursors. This will generate and return new cursors for paginated responses.
For version 24.0 and newer requests, the [status messages](https://developers.facebook.com/documentation/business-messaging/whatsapp/webhooks/reference/messages/status) webhook no longer includes the `conversation` object, unless the webhook is for a message sent during an open [Free Entry Point window](https://developers.facebook.com/documentation/business-messaging/whatsapp/pricing#free-entry-point-windows).

_Business Management API_, _Cloud API_

Graph API version 16 is now available. Changes to [message template categories](https://developers.facebook.com/documentation/business-messaging/whatsapp/changelog#new-message-template-categories), [API error responses](https://developers.facebook.com/documentation/business-messaging/whatsapp/changelog#api-error-response-behavior), and [webhooks](https://developers.facebook.com/documentation/business-messaging/whatsapp/changelog#webhooks) have been introduced as part of this version.

_Cloud API_

Templates [created or edited](https://developers.facebook.com/documentation/business-messaging/whatsapp/templates/overview) using v16.0 must now be categorized using one of the following categories; all other categories are no longer supported. Applies to Cloud API v16.0+. Will apply to all versions May 1, 2023. This change has been introduced to support our June 1, 2023 switch to a new conversation-based pricing model.

`AUTHENTICATION`
`MARKETING`
`UTILITY`
Error subcodes, which are rarely used and should not be relied upon, will no longer be included in v16.0+ error responses. Use `code` and `details` instead.
Error code 100 (`"code":100`) had multiple unique titles which indicated the nature of a given 100 error. All code 100 errors will now use `Invalid parameter` as their title. Old titles that described the nature of a given code 100 error have been moved to the `details` property. This change is also now reflected in webhooks payloads that describe a code 100 error response.

_Cloud API Webhooks_

The `errors` object in webhooks triggered by v16.0+ request errors now include `message` and `error_data.details` properties, and `title` values have changed for multiple error codes. Now, `errors` objects have the following structure and data:

```
[\
  {\
    "code": &lt;CODE&gt;,\
    "title" : "&lt;TITLE&gt;",\
    "message": "&lt;MESSAGE&gt;",\
    "error_data": {\
      "details": "&lt;DETAILS&gt;"\
    }\
  },\
  ...\

```

The `title` property value has been updated for the following error codes. Their old values now appear in `error_data.details`.

`130470` new title is now `Re-engagement message`
`130429` new title is now `Rate limit hit`
`131045` new title is now `Incorrect certificate`
`131031` new title is now `Business Account locked`
`131053` new title is now `Media upload error`
`131027` new title is now `Something went wrong`
`131042` new title is now `Business eligibility payment issue`
`131026` new title is now `Message Undeliverable`
`131000` new title is now `Something went wrong`
The `message` property value is the same as the `title` property value, which indicates the error code’s title.
This property maps to the `message` property in [API error response payloads](https://developers.facebook.com/documentation/business-messaging/whatsapp/support/error-codes).
The `error_data.details` property now includes error code titles from the error codes listed above and describes the underlying cause of the error. This value maps to the `details` property in API error response payloads.

These changes are reflected in the following `errors` properties in error-related webhooks:

`entry.changes.value.errors`
`entry.changes.value.messages.errors`
`entry.changes.value.statuses.errors`

_On-Premises API_

**v2.43**

Starting in `v2.43`, there will be changes to the behavior of the [`contacts` endpoint](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/whatsapp/on-premises/reference/contacts)
[Responses for `status` will change](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/whatsapp/on-premises/reference/contacts#returned-fields). Regardless of whether a user has WhatsApp, it will always return `valid` for `status` in the response and a `wa_id`. There is no guarantee that the returned wa_id will be valid. These changes are applicable for both direct responses, as well as webhook responses for non-blocking calls
Ensure your code avoids relying on `status` and `wa_id` returned in the `contacts` node. In addition, [sending a message](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/whatsapp/on-premises/reference/messages) on `v2.39.1` or higher can be completed without calling the `contacts` node
Ensure your code handles a potential `1013` **User is not valid** error when trying to send a template message, which will be returned if you attempt to send the template message to a phone number without a WhatsApp account
For non template messages, sending a message to a phone number without a WhatsApp account will return a `470` error

**v2.45, January 10, 2023**

Starting in `v2.45`, the [optional `cert` parameter](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/whatsapp/multiconnect_mc#parameters) in the `shards` node will become mandatory for all requests. Please update your integration to always include a valid `cert` when calling the `shards` node
Starting in `v2.41.2`, businesses can use the [`application` node](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/whatsapp/on-premises/reference/settings/app) to filter out sent message statuses they are not interested in through the `message` object within the `webhooks` object. In `v2.45`, `sent_status` will be deprecated, so update your integration to use the [`webhooks` object in the `application` node](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/whatsapp/on-premises/reference/settings/app#webhooks) for all webhook controls
As of `v2.39.1`, `recipient_id` is available in both the [`statuses` object](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/whatsapp/on-premises/webhooks/outbound#status--message-sent) and in the `message` object. In `v2.45`, `recipient_id` will be removed in the [`statuses` object](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/whatsapp/on-premises/webhooks/outbound#status--message-sent), so update your integration to use `recipient_id` under the `message` object

## September 19, 2022

**v2.41.3**

The `v2.41.3` version of our Business API client added a new table index on `message_receipt_log` that could benefit partners with high throughput needs. For instance, this improvement allows partners to send more than 200 messages/second.

## June 27, 2022

_On-Premises API_

**Best practices for a seamless upgrade to v2.41.2**

In v2.41.2, we are introducing DB schema changes to improve the performance of the system. As a result, upgrades from v2.37.2 and v2.39.x for set ups with large databases which have millions of message and contact entries will take longer than usual.

Generally, perform upgrades during off-peak hours and upgrade lower-throughput setups first.

For large databases, follow these steps:

Run garbage collection via the [/services/message/gc](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/whatsapp/on-premises/reference/services) endpoint before your upgrade, and ensure it completes successfully
Please use the [dbupgrade tool](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/whatsapp/on-premises/get-started/installation/dev-multiconnect#for-mysql-database-users-upgrading-to-v2-23-x-and-above) to upgrade the DB schemas prior to the version upgrade.

Once done, you will be able to upgrade API versions with minimal down time. It is strongly recommended to bring the API client down before using the dbupgrade tool.

Ensure the dbupgrade tool completes successfully (exit code 0), and avoid or limit API requests while the upgrade is taking place.

We recommend increasing the query timeout on your database servers to one hour, until the upgrade completes successfully.

**v2.41.2 features and updates**

Improvements to the latency of the bulk [/contacts](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/whatsapp/on-premises/reference/contacts) endpoint requests and resolution of deadlock issues.
Improvements to the performance and reliability of the [garbage collection process](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/whatsapp/on-premises/reference/services).
Businesses now have the ability to enable/disable `delivered` and `read` webhook notifications which gives them greater control over webhook notifications for messages. This can be achieved through the [settings/applications](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/whatsapp/on-premises/reference/settings/app) endpoint.
`namespace` field is optional for the [template object](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/whatsapp/on-premises/reference/messages#template-object).
More robust handling of media download errors so businesses should experience less issues downloading media sent by customers.
Additional reliability and bug fixes within the send message and registration workflows.

**v2.39.4**

This client version contains [all features and fixes shipped with `v2.39.1`](https://developers.facebook.com/documentation/business-messaging/whatsapp/changelog#on-prem-v2391). Additionally, this release:

Fixes a bug that prevented video messages from being sent under certain circumstances. _This fix was also included in `v2.39.2`._
Fixes a bug that prevented businesses from sending messages to a customer, if the customer was the first to initiate an interaction between the two parties on WhatsApp, and that initiation happened more than 7 days ago. This fix was also included in `v2.39.3`.
Fixes a bug that prevented businesses from receiving disappearing messages from customers. After `v2.39.4` is installed, businesses will get notified they received a disappearing message by a webhooks notification with type set to `"ephemeral"`. Businesses will not be able to see the message’s content.

When we launched `v2.39.3`, the disappearing messages issue was handled by WhatsApp automatically disabling these messages in the chat thread with the client. For `v2.39.4`, we will not do that. With this version, businesses that receive disappearing messages must ask the customer to disable disappearing messages and resend their latest message.

Starting May 2, 2022, businesses will be able to message customers immediately after signup and only need to complete Business Verification when they’re ready to scale business-initiated conversations or request to become an Official Business Account.

The changes mean that onboarded businesses will be able to:

Respond to unlimited customer-initiated conversations.
Send business-initiated conversations to 50 unique customers in a rolling 24-hour period.

These are the changes being implemented on May 2, 2022:

WhatsApp Account checks and display name review will no longer be a requirement to get started on the platform. After signup, a compliance check with the WhatsApp Platform Policy Checks will be auto-triggered and will be performed in the background.
Display name review will be initiated after Business Verification is completed. Businesses should still follow the display name best practice guidelines when adding a new phone number. For more information, see Display Names.
Business Verification only needs to be completed when businesses are ready to scale business-initiated conversations or request to become an Official Business Account (OBA). For more information, see how to increase limits.
Since businesses get access to sending messages after sign up, the Unverified Trial Experience will be deprecated.
Businesses will be able to see the messaging limits in the Overview Dashboard in WhatsApp Manager -after completing the signup process.

The changes listed above have no impact on pricing. See pricing for more details.

_Cloud API_

Starting today, the Cloud API is generally available to all existing Solution Partners and direct clients. Additionally, we’re releasing the following features for Cloud API developers:

**Messages with Stickers**: Send media messages containing third-party static stickers. See the following documentation for more details: [Reference, Messages](https://developers.facebook.com/documentation/business-messaging/whatsapp/reference/whatsapp-business-phone-number/message-api) and [Reference, Media](https://developers.facebook.com/documentation/business-messaging/whatsapp/business-phone-numbers/media). We support inbound both and outbound stickers. For outbound, we only support static third-party stickers. For inbound, we support all types of stickers.
**Deregister Phone Number API**: Make `POST` calls to `PHONE_NUMBER_ID/deregister` in order to remove a phone number from the WhatsApp Business API. See [Registration](https://developers.facebook.com/documentation/business-messaging/whatsapp/business-phone-numbers/registration#deregister-phone) for information.
**New Phone Verification Option**: Verify your business phone number via Graph API calls. See [Phone Numbers](https://developers.facebook.com/documentation/business-messaging/whatsapp/business-phone-numbers/phone-numbers#verify) for information.
**New Referral Webhooks**: Receive Webhooks notifications when a user clicks on an ad that clicks to WhatsApp and sends a message to the business. See [Webhooks](https://developers.facebook.com/documentation/business-messaging/whatsapp/webhooks/overview#received-message-triggered-by-click-to-whatsapp-ads) for information. Be aware that the Cloud API’s webhooks `referral` object is different from the On-Premises API’s `referral` object.

Additionally, we are announcing that App Review is no longer required for first-party developers using the Cloud API. All developers are subject to the [WhatsApp Business Platform messaging limits](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/whatsapp/api/rate-limits#messaging).

_On-Premises API_

**v2.37.2**

This version contains the same features as [`v2.37.1`](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/whatsapp/changelog/archive#wa237), but there’s a different expiration date. `v2.37.2` expires on Sep 22, 2022.

Known Issues:

Some Kubernetes developers may see `CrashLoopBackOff` for their webapp container and their container may fail to start. To fix that, add following line in the Kubernetes deployment `YML` file under webapp configuration:

```
command: ["/opt/whatsapp/bin/wait_on_mysql.sh", "/opt/whatsapp/bin/launch_within_docker.sh"]
```

## March 25, 2022

_On-Premises API_

**v2.39.3**

The `v2.39.3` version of our Business API client is available for developers today. The new client includes two fixes and additional logs to support debugging. The two fixes are:

Fixed a bug that prevented businesses from sending messages to a customer, if the customer was the first to initiate an interaction between the two parties on WhatsApp, and that initiation happened more than 7 days ago.
Fixed a bug that prevented businesses from receiving disappearing messages from customers. After v2.39.3 is installed, businesses will get notified they received a disappearing message by a webhooks notification. On their end, customers will see a warning saying that the disappearing messages mode has been turned off.

Starting today, WhatsApp has switched from a notification-based pricing model to a conversation-based pricing model. Businesses are charged per conversation, which includes all messages delivered in a 24 hour session. See [Conversation-Based Pricing](https://developers.facebook.com/documentation/business-messaging/whatsapp/pricing) for information.

Starting today, Cloud API beta users can start sending and receiving location and contact messages. See the documentation below for more information:

_On-Premises API_

**v2.39.1**

The `2.39.1` version of our Business API client is available for developers starting today. The new client includes:

[New field for the Set Shards API](https://developers.facebook.com/documentation/business-messaging/whatsapp/changelog#set-shards-api).
[New hostname added to network requirements](https://developers.facebook.com/documentation/business-messaging/whatsapp/changelog#new-hostname).
[New error code `1031`](https://developers.facebook.com/documentation/business-messaging/whatsapp/changelog#error-code-updates).
[Deprecations of the `hsm` type and the `webhook_payload_conversation_pricingmodel_disabled` application setting](https://developers.facebook.com/documentation/business-messaging/whatsapp/changelog#deprecations-v239).

**Set Shards API**

Starting with the new API client version, you may provide your phone’s certificate when you are setting up multiconnect. That means that, when calling the /v1/account/shards endpoint, you can add the Base64-encoded certificate in the cert field. See [Scale Your API Client With Multiconnect](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/whatsapp/multiconnect_mc) for information.

**New Hostname**

We have added `graph.whatsapp.com` to the list of WhatsApp server hostnames that the Business API client requires connectivity to. See [Set Up and Debug Your Network, Hostnames](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/whatsapp/guides/network-requirements) for information.

**Error Code Updates**

With `v2.39`, we have added error code `1031`. You will get this error if your account has been locked and can’t send any messages due to an integrity policy violation. See [Error and Status Messages](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/whatsapp/api/errors#error) and [Policy Enforcement](https://developers.facebook.com/documentation/business-messaging/whatsapp/policy-enforcement) for information.

**Deprecations**

**Messages API**: The `hsm` type has been deprecated with `v2.39`. You should use the `template` type instead.
**Application Setting**: The application setting `webhook_payload_conversation_pricingmodel_disabled` has been deprecated.

**Known Issues**

Some video messages fail to send under certain circumstances.

**Audio Messages**

Starting today, Cloud API beta users can start sending [audio messages](https://developers.facebook.com/documentation/business-messaging/whatsapp/reference/whatsapp-business-phone-number/message-api) to their customers. For supported audio types, see our [media documentation](https://developers.facebook.com/documentation/business-messaging/whatsapp/business-phone-numbers/media#supported-media-types).

**Webhooks**

We have updated our [webhooks documentation](https://developers.facebook.com/documentation/business-messaging/whatsapp/webhooks/overview) to clarify the following: **if you receive a message type that is not yet supported by Cloud API, you will be notified via an [unknown message webhook](https://developers.facebook.com/documentation/business-messaging/whatsapp/webhooks/overview#received-unknown-messages)**. This means that, for the current API beta release, you will get an unknown message webhook if you receive any of the following message types: Media Messages (Video), Contact Messages, Location Messages, Stickers, Stickerpacks.
