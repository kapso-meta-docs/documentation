## Introduction to Load Test on Cloud API

### What is an API Load Test?

API Load Testing is a crucial process for assessing how well your application servers handle the expected production traffic. It allows you to systematically apply the anticipated load to your servers and observe how your application behaves. By conducting API Load Testing, you can identify any weaknesses or bottlenecks before your users encounter them, ensuring that your application is robust enough to handle the desired workload.

At Meta, we recognize the importance of API Load Testing and provide a comprehensive feature within our WhatsApp Cloud API that enables you to simulate traffic on the messaging API endpoint and evaluate their performance under various conditions. This feature empowers you to examine the overall performance of your API integration and assess its ability to handle concurrent requests from a large number of virtual users.

We understand the dynamic and demanding landscape of digital communication, and our commitment is firmly rooted in enabling businesses to thrive within it. By offering this feature, we empower our clients to stay ahead of the curve, delivering exceptional messaging services that can withstand the challenges posed by ever-increasing user demands and market fluctuations.

### What types of Load Tests are available?

At present, our Cloud API offers “Outbound Load Test.” This feature serves as a powerful tool for businesses to evaluate and enhance the resiliency of their WhatsApp Cloud API integration. By conducting Outbound Load Testing, clients can gain insightful measurements regarding their system’s performance and identify areas for improvement.

The ability to proactively assess and optimize their systems is paramount for businesses aiming to provide seamless messaging experiences for their customers, even during periods of peak usage. By leveraging the Outbound Load Test feature, clients can gain confidence in the robustness and scalability of their WhatsApp Cloud API integration, ensuring that it can handle high message volumes without sacrificing performance or user experience.

### Why should you perform Outbound Load Testing using Cloud API?

Performing Outbound Load Testing using our Cloud API offers significant benefits in two distinct scenarios:

**Solution Partners Tracking**: Solution Partners can leverage load testing to track the time series of API requests made and the corresponding responses received. This enables Solution Partners to gain valuable insights into the performance of their systems over time. By monitoring these metrics, Solution Partners can identify patterns, analyze response times, and ensure optimal service delivery to their clients.

**Message Status Webhook Monitoring**: For businesses, load testing provides a means to monitor the number of message status webhooks received on their designated endpoint during the testing period. By analyzing webhook data, businesses can gauge the responsiveness and reliability of their systems in real-time. This allows them to proactively detect any issues, optimize their webhook handling processes, and ensure seamless message status updates for their users.

In both scenarios, load testing serves as a powerful tool for assessing and improving webhook performance. Whether it is tracking API request-response dynamics or monitoring message status webhooks, load testing empowers businesses and Solution Partners to enhance their services, optimize workflows, and deliver exceptional user experiences.

## Preparing for the Load Test

To ensure a smooth and effective load test experience, appropriate preparation is crucial. In the case of an outbound load test with Meta, we provide essential components to facilitate the process. Specifically, we will furnish you with a designated test number that will serve as the sender of the load test messages. Additionally, a range of dummy numbers will be provided to act as end user numbers for the test.

The test number we provide has been purposefully designed to process all the requests similar to a regular number would, but it will not deliver the messages to actual recipients. This thoughtful design prevents any inadvertent spamming of real numbers during the load test, maintaining the integrity of the process.

To initiate the load test, clients are required to create load test requests via our Direct Support channel. This ensures streamlined communication and enables our team to provide prompt assistance and guidance throughout the testing phase.

To set up the load test successfully, we kindly request the following information from our clients:

**Existing Message Template Example**: We require a sample of the message template you intend to use for the load test. This includes the associated name and WhatsApp Business Account (WABA) linked to it. Providing us with this information allows us to accurately replicate your messaging setup during the load test, ensuring realistic testing conditions.

**Webhook URL**: Please provide us with the URL of the webhook endpoint that will receive notifications and data from the load test. This enables us to capture and analyze the responses and behavior of your system during the test, allowing for thorough evaluation and optimization.

**Webhook URL verify token**: Please provide us the webhook verify token so that we can override your Webhook URL to receive notifications.

Once the load test session is confirmed, our dedicated support team will provide you with the necessary resources on the day of the load test, including:

**Test Number**: We will furnish you with a dedicated test number that will serve as the sender for the load test messages. This number is specifically designed to process all the requests like a regular number would, without delivering the messages to actual recipients. This ensures the load test is conducted accurately while safeguarding the privacy of real numbers.

**Access Token**: You will receive an access token that grants you the necessary authorization to initiate and monitor the load test.

**Message Template**: We will provide the specific message template and its corresponding details to be used during the testing. This includes the content, structure, and any variables or placeholders that need to be included within the messages.

Our support team will be available throughout the load test to provide guidance, address any queries, and ensure a smooth testing experience.

**Note**: It is crucial to ensure that no incoming messages are sent to the test number when registering or obtaining the ID of the outbound number. Sending a message to the test number during the load test can trigger a circuit breaker mechanism, resulting in the disconnection of the load test number. To maintain a stable and uninterrupted load test session, please refrain from sending any messages to the designated test number during the setup and execution of the load test.

With these steps completed, the Grafana configuration is now finished, and you are ready to run your JMeter test. Ensure that both JMeter and InfluxDB are running, and then execute the JMeter test to populate the Grafana dashboard you have just set up.

### Running the Test in JMeter

Once you have completed the setup steps outlined in the previous section, follow these instructions to run the test using JMeter:

Navigate to the **Thread Group** element in your JMeter test plan. This is where you configure the test settings.
Specify the desired number of threads or users that will simulate concurrent access to your application. Each thread represents a virtual user. The number of threads directly impacts the load on your system.
Set the ramp-up period to define how JMeter gradually increases the number of users from zero to the desired total. The ramp-up period is measured in seconds and determines the time it takes for JMeter to start all the specified users and reach the maximum number of users. For example, if you have 1000 users and a ramp-up period of 100 seconds, JMeter will start a new user every 0.1 seconds (1000 users / 100 seconds) until all 1000 users are active.
Once you have configured the test with the appropriate number of threads and the ramp-up period, you can proceed to start the test. Click on the start button, represented by a green play button, to initiate the load test.

By following these steps, you will have successfully set up Locust for load testing and ensured the necessary dependencies and configurations are in place.

### Running the Test in Locust

Once you have completed the setup steps outlined in the previous section, follow these instructions to run the test using Locust:

Navigate to the folder where you installed the load test zip file.

Open your terminal or command prompt and run the following command to start the Locust server on port 8089:

```
locust -f locustFile.py
```

After running the command, open your web browser and go to [http://localhost:8089/](https://l.facebook.com/l.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Flocalhost%3A8089%2F&h=AT3sBKEW8DA_4HWSU8DZlHhZr1vaUyG3Ch7lWnesQvEPCF4yYMlWEa6ztRXYksaSVqmZB5iDLMMpSwmTa3JHedkTnkNnXNWofns_QD8pZK9_HWtji0YGWv86EDUqq-uefSNSqWdHYZ3q0A). This will open the Locust web interface.

In the Locust web interface, click on **New Test** to configure your test.

Specify the desired number of users for your load test. These users represent the simulated virtual users or clients that generate traffic to your application during the test. The number of users determines the amount of concurrent traffic generated.

Set the spawn rate, which determines the rate at which new virtual users are created during the load test. It controls how quickly the number of concurrent users ramps up. For example, if you set a spawn rate of 10 users per second, Locust will start with a few users and gradually increase the number of active users by 10 each second until the desired number of users is reached.

Take into consideration the optimal user-to-throughput ratio for your test. As a general guideline, you can add approximately 100 users for every 300 messages per second (MPS) throughput. Keep in mind that each user takes approximately 350ms to compute.
