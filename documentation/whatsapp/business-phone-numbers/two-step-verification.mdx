# Two-Step Verification

Updated: Nov 5, 2025

You are required to set up two-step verification for your phone number, as this provides an extra layer of security to the business accounts. To set it up, make a `POST` call to `/PHONE_NUMBER_ID` and attach the parameters below. There is no endpoint to disable two-step verification.

| Endpoint | Authentication |
| --- | --- |
| `/PHONE_NUMBER_ID`<br />(See [Get Phone Number ID](https://developers.facebook.com/documentation/business-messaging/whatsapp/business-phone-numbers/phone-numbers#get-all-phone-numbers)) | Solution Partners must authenticate themselves with an access token with the `whatsapp_business_management` and `whatsapp_business_messaging` permissions. |

### Parameters

| Name | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `pin` | **Required.**<br />A 6-digit PIN you wish to use for two-step verification. |

### Example

Sample request:

```
curl -X  POST \
 'https://graph.facebook.com/v24.0/FROM_PHONE_NUMBER_ID' \
 -H 'Authorization: Bearer ACCESS_TOKEN' \
 -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
 -d '{"pin" : "6_DIGIT_PIN"}'
```

Sample response:

```
\{
  "success": true
}
```

All API calls require authentication with access tokens.

Developers can authenticate their API calls with the access token generated in the **App Dashboard** \> **WhatsApp** \> **API Setup**.

Solution Partners must authenticate themselves with an access token with the `whatsapp_business_messaging` and `whatsapp_business_management` permissions. See [System User Access Tokens](https://developers.facebook.com/documentation/business-messaging/whatsapp/access-tokens#system-user-access-tokens) for information.

## Resetting your PIN

If you forget or misplace your PIN, you can update it by following these steps in WhatsApp Manager:

Go to [settings](https://business.facebook.com/settings/), log into your Facebook Business, and click the business you are using to manage your WABA (WhatsApp Business Account).
In the settings screen, click **WhatsApp Accounts** and find the WABA you want to update the PIN for. Click on the WABA and a panel with its respective info will come up on the right-side of the page.
In the WABA info panel, click **Settings**.
In the new tab, click **WhatsApp Manager**.
In WhatsApp Manager, find your phone number and click **Settings**.
Click **Two-step verification**.
In the Two-step verification tab, click **Change PIN**.
You will be prompted to enter a new PIN and confirm it. You have now successfully updated your PIN.
