# QR Codes and Short Links

Updated: Oct 31, 2025

WhatsApp QR codes and short links create a digital doorstep for businesses, enabling them to stay connected with their existing customers and connect with new ones. This way, customers can simply scan QR codes with their mobile device camera or type in a short link to begin a chat thread, without needing to input a phone number.

You can view, create, edit and delete QR codes and short links in the [WhatsApp Business Management API](https://developers.facebook.com/documentation/business-messaging/whatsapp/qr-codes) or in the [Business Manager UI](https://www.facebook.com/business/help/890732351439459).

### Limitations

A single WABA phone number cannot be associated with more than 2,000 QR codes and short links.

A QR code scan can initiate a pre-filled message containing up to 140 characters of text.

Analytics are not available for QR Codes and Short Links as we limit the amount of data we log to protect user privacy.

## Create QR code

To create a QR code, send a POST request to the [WhatsApp Business Phone Number > Message Qrdls](https://developers.facebook.com/documentation/business-messaging/whatsapp/reference/whatsapp-business-phone-number/whatsapp-business-qr-code-management-api) endpoint.

In your post body, include an object with a `prefilled_message` property set to your message text and a `generate_qr_image` property set to your preferred image format, either `SVG` or `PNG`.

### Example request

```
curl 'https://graph.facebook.com/v24.0/106540352242922/message_qrdls' \
-H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
-H 'Authorization: Bearer EAAJB...' \
-d '
\{
  "prefilled_message": "Cyber Monday",
  "generate_qr_image": "SVG"
}'
```

### Example response

## Prefilled messages

QR codes and short links can be programmed to populate a prefilled message. Prefilled messages can contain up to 140 characters of text. These messages are fully customizable and can be updated or deleted at any time.

## User experience

| User Scenario | Expected Behavior |
| --- | --- |
| User tries to access a code or link that has been deleted. | User sees an error message saying “This QR code \[short link\] has expired”. |
| User scans the QR code or types in the short link of a business they previously blocked. | User gets a prompt asking if they would like to unblock the business to continue messaging them. |
| User clicks a short link on a desktop browser. | Desktop client launches with message populated in chat thread. If there is no client installed, user is prompted to install it. |

## Best practices

### Format

We recommend outputting the QR code as a scalable vector graphic (`.svg`) file. You can resize your QR Code to develop product packaging, signage, etc.

### Appearance

While we do not offer the capability to natively customize QR codes, you can do so by downloading and editing QR codes with the software of your choice. We recommend you do not customize the color or look and feel of the code itself in order to preserve readability.

## FAQs

**How do I create a QR code or short link?**

**What is the best format to use to optimize print quality of a QR code?**

**How do short links improve on the existing wa.me links?**

The new short links enable prefilled messages associated with a link to be edited or deleted at any time. They also reduce the syntax of the URL to a random code, which eliminates the need to embed messages in the URL and masks the phone number.

If the user has the WhatsApp desktop client installed, it will launch a chat thread with your business. If not, the user will be prompted to install the WhatsApp desktop client.

**What happens when a user scans a QR code or clicks a short link that has been deleted?**

If a user tries to access a QR code or short link that has been deleted, they will see an error message indicating the QR code/short link has expired.

QR codes can now be generated and managed directly within the WhatsApp Business Management API and users can scan them with their WhatsApp, iOS, or Android camera.

Prefilled messages are fully customizable and can be changed or deleted at any time,
