Marketing Messages API for WhatsApp (formerly known as Marketing Messages Lite API) is now generally available.

Learn how to send a template message with the Marketing Messages API for WhatsApp (MM API for WhatsApp).

## Requirements

You have an active WhatsApp Business Account and are in a [country eligible for MM API for WhatsApp](https://developers.facebook.com/documentation/business-messaging/whatsapp/marketing-messages/get-started#geographic-availability-of-features).
You have an approved [marketing template message](https://developers.facebook.com/documentation/business-messaging/whatsapp/templates/marketing-templates).
You are subscribed to the [messages](https://developers.facebook.com/documentation/business-messaging/whatsapp/webhooks/reference/messages) webhook.

## Step 1: Accept Terms of Service

Navigate to the [**App Dashboard**](https://developers.facebook.com/apps) \> **WhatsApp** \> **Quickstart** panel.
Locate the “ **Improve ROI with marketing messages with optimizations**” module and click the “ **Get started**” button.
Click on “ **Continue to integration guide**” and accept the Terms of Service.

## Step 2: Send a marketing template message

Use the `marketing_messages` endpoint to send a template message to yourself.

```
curl 'https://graph.facebook.com/&lt;API_VERSION&gt;/&lt;WHATSAPP_BUSINESS_PHONE_NUMBER_ID&gt;/marketing_messages' \
-H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
-H 'Authorization: Bearer &lt;ACCESS_TOKEN&gt;' \
-d
'{
  "messaging_product": "whatsapp",
  "recipient_type": "individual",
  "to": "&lt;WHATSAPP_USER_PHONE_NUMBER&gt;",
  "type": "template",
  "template": {
      "name": "&lt;TEMPLATE_NAME&gt;",
      "language": {
          "code": "&lt;LANGUAGE_AND_LOCALE_CODE&gt;"
      },
      "components": [\
          {\
              "type": "body",\
              "parameters": [\
                  {\
                      "type": "text",\
                      "text": "text-string"\
                  }\
              ]\
          }\
      ]
  }
}'
```

## Step 3: Verify message was sent through the `status` webhook

MM API for WhatsApp triggers [status messages webhooks](https://developers.facebook.com/documentation/business-messaging/whatsapp/webhooks/reference/messages/status) for events such as sent, delivered, and read. When a message is sent via MM API for WhatsApp, the webhook payload will have `category` and `conversation.origin.type` set to `marketing_lite`.

```
\{
  "conversation": {
    "id": "&lt;CONVERSATION_ID&gt;",
    "origin": {
      "type": "marketing_lite"
    }
  },
  "pricing": {
    "billable": true,
    "pricing_model": "PMP",
    "category": "marketing_lite"
  }
}
```

## Geographic availability of features

Some advanced features and reporting capabilities of MM API for WhatsApp are available only in particular geographies due to Meta policy and/or local regulation.

### European Economic Area, United Kingdom, Japan, South Korea

Messages sent from a business phone number in these countries, or to a consumer in these countries, will not receive delivery optimizations. **Note** that [per-user marketing message template limits](https://developers.facebook.com/documentation/business-messaging/whatsapp/templates/marketing-templates/per-user-limits) are also not active in these countries, so a lack of delivery optimizations will not have any effect on message delivery.
Messages sent from a business phone number in these countries, or to a consumer in these countries, will not have click and conversion reporting metrics available.
For businesses in these countries, metrics are not available on Ads Manager UI or Insights API. As with Cloud API, metrics will be available via Business Management API and WhatsApp Manager UI ‘conversation’ metrics.

### United States

Starting Apr 1, 2025, marketing messages sent to WhatsApp users in the United States will not be delivered (error code 131049). Note that this policy is not specific to MM API for WhatsApp - it is in place across all Business Messaging APIs (including Cloud API, [see docs](https://developers.facebook.com/documentation/business-messaging/whatsapp/templates/marketing-templates/per-user-limits)).
Businesses phone numbers in the US will continue to be able to use MM API for WhatsApp to message users outside of the United States.
