Updated: Nov 4, 2025

Template messages are used to send [templates](https://developers.facebook.com/documentation/business-messaging/whatsapp/templates/overview) to WhatsApp users. Templates can cover customer care messages, appointment reminders, payment and shipping updates, and much more.

Templates are reusable and can be sent to WhatsApp users outside of a [customer service window](https://developers.facebook.com/documentation/business-messaging/whatsapp/messages/send-messages#customer-service-windows), however they must be approved before they can be sent in a template message. Templates are also subject to multiple processes that can affect your ability to send them to users, such as quality scores, pausing, and pacing.

Because there’s a lot to know about templates, we have dedicated [Templates](https://developers.facebook.com/documentation/business-messaging/whatsapp/templates/overview) documentation that explains how to use them effectively.
