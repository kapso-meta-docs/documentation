Try viewing the Flow in the Flow Builder UI which will highlight and explain any errors (see [Create Your First Flow](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/whatsapp/flows/gettingstarted/createyourfirstflowin30secs) for a guide to getting started with the Flows Builder UI. You can also view a list of validation errors for your Flow via the API (see [Retrieving Flow Details](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/whatsapp/flows/reference/flowsapi#details)). Once the errors are resolved, try publishing your Flow again. |

## Business Endpoint Error Codes

If the Flow is using a business-provided endpoint, that endpoint may return specific HTTP response codes in case of certain types of errors to trigger appropriate client-side behavior.

| HTTP Response Code | Server-side situation                      | Client-side behavior and details                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
