# Receiving Flow Response

Upon flow completion a response message will be sent to the WhatsApp chat. You will receive it in the same way as you receive all other messages from the user - via message webhook. `response_json` field will contain flow-specific data.

The structure of flow-specific data is controlled by Flow JSON or, in case you are using Endpoint for your flow, by final response payload from endpoint. See [Response Message Webhook](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/whatsapp/flows/reference/responsemsgwebhook) reference page for more details.

The Flow response does not include the Flow ID. You can include a custom field in your Flow payload or an identifier in the `flow_token` field to identify the corresponding Flow.

    },\

      }\
    },\
    "timestamp": "&lt;MESSAGE_SEND_TIMESTAMP&gt;"\
  }]
}
