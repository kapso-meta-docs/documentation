### Ticket severity

Ticket severity is generated based on the type of issue selected and information provided in your submission. We will review your ticket and investigate the issue according to the severity level and time of submission.

The criteria used to evaluate the severity of your ticket is outlined in the table below.

| Severity | Issue Type |
| --- | --- |
| **1 - Critical** | This issue severely impacts your production environment by causing the API to not function at all. You are not able to send any messages and/or add/register any phone numbers.<br />It halts your business operations and there are no procedural workarounds. |
| **2 - Urgent** | This issue impacts your production environment by impeding API functions, resulting in a majority of message send failures.<br />It causes major disruptions to significant portions of your business operations, and there are no procedural workarounds. |
| **3 - Standard** | This issue impacts your production environment, with the API having minor or intermittent issues, resulting in some message send failures.<br />It causes minor disruptions to portions of your business operations, but there are procedural workarounds.<br />It also includes all other issues not classified as **Critical** or **Urgent**. |

When a **Critical** or **Urgent** ticket is resolved but with outstanding request(s), we update the severity to **Mitigated**.

## Troubleshooting

### Message not delivered

The following scenarios can cause a message to appear as sent but not delivered. For many of these reasons, **we will not disclose the underlying cause of the error**, because of privacy and policy reasons. The reasons messages appear as ‘sent’ but are not delivered include, but are not limited to, the following:

The customer did not come online during the 30 day window where we hold messages for offline customers.
The customer has blocked the business phone number, or another business phone number owned by the business.
The customer is in a [restricted or sanctioned country](https://developers.facebook.com/documentation/business-messaging/whatsapp/support#country-restrictions).

In some scenarios, the API returns an [error code](https://developers.facebook.com/documentation/business-messaging/whatsapp/support/error-codes) with an error message describing the nature of the error. Example scenarios:

Invalid request parameters
Integrity errors
The customer has not accepted our new Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Please send your end user this link [https://wa.me/tos/20210210](https://l.facebook.com/l.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwa.me%2Ftos%2F20210210&h=AT1bxYo6Ya03rebN77N75369yMVgdYZESBUXJvs3RYaTxtz3B6fzajuGIlZNvuVh5yoZ2XSF_8U7z1aBqBPDfWqZnS2Ni-3NeZai69pQeMiXmSRiXjb21CjQe9ch9BxKaMufk4Q4Hyde6A) to accept the latest Terms of Service.
The customer is using an old version of WhatsApp. Customers should use the following version or greater:
Android: 2.21.15.15
SMBA: 2.21.15.15
iOS: 2.21.170.4
SMBI: 2.21.170.4
KaiOS: 2.2130.10
Web: 2.2132.6
The customer is part of an [experiment](https://developers.facebook.com/documentation/business-messaging/whatsapp/support/experiments) group.

#### Possible solutions

Using a non-WhatsApp communication method, ask the WhatsApp user to:

confirm that they can actually send a message to your WhatsApp business phone number(s)
confirm that none of your WhatsApp business phone numbers are in their list of blocked numbers ( **Settings** \> **Privacy** \> **Blocked** or **Blocked contacts**)
confirm that they have accepted our latest Terms of Service ( **Settings** \> **Help**, or **Settings** \> **Application information** will prompt them to accept the latest terms/policies if they haven’t done so already)
update to the latest version of the WhatsApp client

### Country restrictions

Businesses in Cuba, Iran, North Korea, Syria, and three sanctioned regions in Ukraine (Crimea, Donetsk, Luhansk) are not eligible to use the WhatsApp Business Platform.

WhatsApp Messenger (WhatsApp) and WhatsApp Business app users in Cuba, Iran, North Korea, Syria, and three sanctioned regions in Ukraine (Crimea, Donetsk, Luhansk) are not eligible to receive messages sent via the WhatsApp Business Platform.

As of May 15, 2024, Türkiye is no longer restricted for Cloud API business messaging. Cloud API businesses can now send and receive messages to and from WhatsApp users who have Turkish numbers.

### Webhooks

#### Conflicting message delivery status

In rare cases, the same message might trigger both success and failure [status messages](https://developers.facebook.com/documentation/business-messaging/whatsapp/webhooks/reference/messages/status) webhooks. For example, a message might trigger status message webhooks with `status` set to `delivered`, and another webhook with `status` set to `failed`. This can happen when a customer is logged in to WhatsApp on multiple devices and the message is successfully delivered to one device but not the other. Any message that triggers a `delivered` status messages webhook has been delivered to at least one of the user’s devices.

### Error Code `2` \- API Service

When we update the API, you might experience up to 5 minutes of downtime. During this period of time, the service is unavailable. We try to make these updates with minimal disruption to businesses, but you might end up being affected

#### How to debug

We suggest that you wait 5 minutes and try to make the API call again.

### Authentication and Authorization Errors

These errors are returned when there was a problem with the access token you are using for the API call.

#### How to debug

You can directly paste the access token you are using into the [Access Token Debugger](https://developers.facebook.com/tools/debug/accesstoken). Then, check if you have selected the `whatsapp_business_management` and `whatsapp_business_messaging` permissions.

If your token doesn’t have access to the permissions, you need to generate a new one. While generating the token, make sure to select:

The Meta app you are using for the API calls
The following permissions: `whatsapp_business_management` and `whatsapp_business_messaging`

## Marketing Messages API for WhatsApp

### I can’t find an admin user at my company to onboard to MM API for WhatsApp

To use MM API for WhatsApp, [onboarding](https://developers.facebook.com/documentation/business-messaging/whatsapp/marketing-messages/onboarding#onboarding-business-customers) must be completed by a user of your business portfolio with “full control” permissions (formerly the admin role). Read more on the various [access permissions available in a business portfolio](https://business.facebook.com/business/help/442345745885606).

If a business (or a partner working with a business), is unable to locate a user with “full control”, follow the steps below to find users with sufficient permission, or claim access to a business portfolio.

### Find or add a user with “full control” permissions

The simplest path to accepting the MM API for WhatsApp terms of service is if a business already knows a user with “full control” permission. If so, that user can go through the MM API for WhatsApp Onboarding flow.

**Find admins via Business Manager.** If the business (or their partner) cannot find a user with “full control”, they can log into Business Manager using another user with “basic access” to find the list of admins with “full control”.

Log into Meta Business Suite, go to “Business Settings” and the “People” tab

Any user of the Business Portfolio with “basic access” or more can view the full list of users, and find one with “full control”.

**Find admins via an API call.** If the business is unable to find the admin of the business portfolio, however if their partner has a BISU token with business_management permissions (API), they can fetch a list of users with “full control” permissions with the following API endpoints

[WhatsApp Business Account endpoint docs](https://developers.facebook.com/documentation/business-messaging/whatsapp/reference/whatsapp-business-account/whatsapp-business-account-api)

[Business Users endpoint docs](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/marketing-api/reference/business/business_users)

**Submit a request for a new user to be added to the business portfolio.** A business can submit a request to have a user added with “full control” access to a business portfolio. **This process takes 24 hrs on average to ensure a thorough security review if all documents are provided and in order, and should be a last resort after all other options have been exhausted.**

A user from the business may request to be added to the business portfolio with “full access”, providing they meet the documentation requirements outlined below.

Follow instructions to [Submit a request to get full control of a business portfolio](https://www.facebook.com/business/help/474856681929983)

Collect the required documents mentioned in the above link.

With the collected assets, fill out the [contact support form](https://www.facebook.com/business-support-home/contact-support.)

Note: If the desired admin is unable to select a Business from the dropdown list, they can select any random asset from the list and mention the desired BM ID as part of the “description text” in the request. If you are unable to select any asset / do not have any assets to select, reach out to your Partner manager.

## I think my delivery rates are lower on MM API for WhatsApp than they were on Cloud API

**Meta recommends all marketing messages are sent via the next-generation MM API for WhatsApp, to benefit from delivery and feature improvements.** MM API for WhatsApp delivers comparable or a greater number of marketing messages than Cloud API. MM API for WhatsApp allows for more dynamic messaging limits, so marketing messages with high engagement (e.g., messages that receive more reads) can reach more customers.

In India, MM API for WhatsApp marketing messages that receive higher engagement (e.g. reads) observed up to 9% higher messages delivered compared to Cloud API\*.

### Steps to take to troubleshoot lower delivery rates after moving to MM API for WhatsApp:

Ensure your team understands the way that MM API for WhatsApp prioritizes relative to Cloud API. On MM API for WhatsApp, high engagement messages can reach more customers. Where Cloud API’s per-user message limits might not allow a message to be delivered to a user, MM API for WhatsApp can recognize high-engagement message templates (e.g. messages that receive more reads), and when a message is sent, allow for dynamic messaging limits.

**Ensure that you are making an accurate comparison between MM API for WhatsApp and Cloud API.** Many delivery rate differences are attributable to variations such as using different templates, times, or audiences. Verify that you are making an accurate comparison using the below guidelines before submitting a support request:

**Compare the same time period.** To accurately compare message delivery, evaluate campaigns run over the same 4-7 day period. Per-user message limits are dynamic and change in real-time based on message volume, holidays, business activity, and user behavior, making comparisons of results from different timeframes unreliable.

**Compare the same (or extremely similar) templates.** Delivery comparisons often mistakenly contrast message templates with different copy, read rates, and user engagement. Use the same template for both API endpoints. Ensure the template is active and follows guidelines for high-quality marketing messages.

**Compare large campaigns with equivalent audience demographics.** Compare campaigns with at least 100,000 marketing messages sent to functionally identical audience cohorts. For example, randomly divide user segments to avoid bias (e.g., different geographic regions, user filters, or ROI/engagement characteristics). Ensure no recipient receives messages more than once, including from other campaigns.

**Compare the same send time.** Send campaigns to both endpoints simultaneously to minimize external impacts like blocks or flags.

**Ensure that you are not counting retried messages in your “delivery” statistics.** If a message fails to deliver due to per-user marketing message limits, wait 24 hours before retrying (see [error code 131049](https://developers.facebook.com/documentation/business-messaging/whatsapp/support/error-codes)). Repeated retries of the same messages will artificially lower your perceived delivery rate, as the same per-user limit may be still in effect resulting in the same outcome. For example, if 20 of 100 messages fail due to limits and are retried, the true 80% delivery rate could drop to ~67% after just one retry.

**Follow best practices for creating high-engagement marketing messages**

**Quality and Relevance**: Prioritize sending messages that offer clear value to customers and avoid non-relevant or impersonal outreach. Relevant messages are more likely to be read, leading to more engaged prospects and customers.

**Message Quality**:

**Expected**: Customers have opted-in to receive these types of messages and generally engage with your marketing messages. Provide an opt-out option.

**Timely**: Messages are sent at a logical time (e.g., after initial engagement or at a defined cadence) and appropriate frequency.

**Relevant**: Messages are personalized, contain valuable information, and include clear calls to action.

**Use MM API for WhatsApp Features**, for example:

Customizable message validity periods ( [time-to-live](https://developers.facebook.com/documentation/business-messaging/whatsapp/marketing-messages/send-marketing-messages#create-marketing-templates)) to ensure messages are timely

View your [benchmarks recommendations](https://developers.facebook.com/documentation/business-messaging/whatsapp/marketing-messages/view-metrics#benchmark-metrics) to improve performance

## I think my click-through rates are lower on MM API for WhatsApp than they were on Cloud API

Because MM API for WhatsApp prioritizes higher delivery of high-engagement messages for users, more deliveries of high-engagement messages can lead to higher click-through rates (CTR) or other outcomes on the API.

If you are finding a campaign’s click-through rate is lower on MM API for WhatsApp vs. Cloud API, check the following:

**Ensure that you are using an accurate A/B comparison of the same campaigns.** See the guidance above for delivery rates to set up a reliable A/B comparison of the same template, at the same time, to a comparable audience of sufficient size, to ensure that other factors are not invalidating the comparison of CTR on MM API for WhatsApp vs. Cloud API.

**Ensure your URL is compatible with Meta’s conversion measurement.** Broken URLs will lower click-through rate. See directions below.

**Assess whether [automated creative optimizations](https://developers.facebook.com/documentation/business-messaging/whatsapp/marketing-messages/send-marketing-messages#automatic-creative-optimizations) should be enabled for your campaign.** Some businesses are enrolled in a pilot of automated creative optimizations which tests minor variations of marketing message templates, and automatically selects the variant getting the highest click-through rate over time. Work with your partner to determine if your business uses these features and if your campaign is suitable

## I’m not seeing website or app conversion metrics for my marketing messages

Ensure your URL is compatible with conversion measurement by sending a test event. Some partners will reformat URLs prior to sending them to MM API for WhatsApp, which breaks Meta’s ability to append a Click ID to the URL which enables conversion measurement.

Reach out to your Meta partner if you are working with a platform or partner whose URL reformatting breaks Meta’s conversion measurement. If your app is using Meta SDK, you must upgrade your SDK version to Meta Android SDK v17.0.2 or above.

## I still need help

If you have followed all troubleshooting steps above and still are experiencing issues please submit a [direct support question](https://business.facebook.com/direct-support/) using the question type “WABiz: Marketing Messages.”

For lower deliveries on MM API for WhatsApp vs. Cloud API for similar campaigns, select WABiz: Marketing Messages > **Message Delivery** and include the details of how the campaigns you are comparing are accounting for similar time, audience, template, and retry normalization.

## Error Codes

MM API for WhatsApp uses the [same error codes as Cloud API](https://developers.facebook.com/documentation/business-messaging/whatsapp/support/error-codes) with [additional error codes](https://developers.facebook.com/documentation/business-messaging/whatsapp/support/error-codes#mm-lite-api-error-codes).

## FAQs

### General FAQs

**Which company will be providing the Cloud API?**

WhatsApp develops and operates the WhatsApp Business API, which enables businesses to communicate with WhatsApp consumer users on the WhatsApp network. When using the Cloud API, Meta will host the WhatsApp Business API for you and provide an endpoint for the WhatsApp service for your incoming and outgoing WhatsApp communications.

**Are there any additional costs for the Cloud API?**

Access to Cloud API is free, and we expect it to generate additional cost savings for developers, as Meta hosts and maintains the Cloud API.

### Technical implementation FAQs

**What is the architecture of the Cloud API?**

The Cloud API architecture significantly simplifies the Solution Partner’s operational and infrastructure requirements to integrate with WhatsApp Business Platform. First, it removes the infrastructure requirements to run Business API docker containers (CAPEX savings). Second, it obviates the need of operational responsibilities to manage the deployment (OPEX savings).

**How can we migrate from On-Premises to the Cloud API?**

Migrating between the On-Premises API and Cloud API is seamless. See [Migrating from On-Premises API to Cloud API](https://developers.facebook.com/documentation/business-messaging/whatsapp/support/migrating-from-onprem-to-cloud).

**Why does the Cloud API return different error codes when I send the same message?**

Cloud API validates each message request through multiple checks. If any check fails, the message send will not succeed. For reasons of system efficiency and overall health, the order in which these checks are performed may change. As a result, you might receive different error codes for the same API request, depending on which validation fails first.

### Reliability FAQs

**How can I track latency and availability metrics for Cloud API in more detail?**

Please view our [WhatsApp Business API Status Page](https://l.facebook.com/l.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fmetastatus.com%2Fwhatsapp-business-api&h=AT1bxYo6Ya03rebN77N75369yMVgdYZESBUXJvs3RYaTxtz3B6fzajuGIlZNvuVh5yoZ2XSF_8U7z1aBqBPDfWqZnS2Ni-3NeZai69pQeMiXmSRiXjb21CjQe9ch9BxKaMufk4Q4Hyde6A) for Cloud API specific observability metrics.

**How is availability downtime calculated?**

Please view the [API Status Page](https://developers.facebook.com/documentation/business-messaging/whatsapp/support/api-status-page#availability) document for more details.

**How often are availability numbers updated?**

Availability is updated once a day.

**Are there instances where downtime in availability is overridden?**

There could be situations where certain user errors can be automatically counted incorrectly toward downtime. In these situations, we will override the downtime to uptime after detailed analysis within a week.

**Meta Status Page reflects no issues for Cloud API, yet I am still facing issues.**

There may be issues that do not impact our global availability. In these cases, the [WhatsApp Business API Status Page](https://l.facebook.com/l.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fmetastatus.com%2Fwhatsapp-business-api&h=AT1bxYo6Ya03rebN77N75369yMVgdYZESBUXJvs3RYaTxtz3B6fzajuGIlZNvuVh5yoZ2XSF_8U7z1aBqBPDfWqZnS2Ni-3NeZai69pQeMiXmSRiXjb21CjQe9ch9BxKaMufk4Q4Hyde6A) will have a status to reflect that there may be some disruptions that are not affecting global availability. Please submit a [Direct Support](https://business.facebook.com/direct-support) ticket to investigate further.

**Are there instances where downtime in availability is not automatically tracked?**

There are the cases where downtimes in availability are not automatically tracked:

Network issues causing requests to fail before they reach the Graph API layer (first layer).
Network issues causing outbound webhooks not to reach business’s webhook endpoint.

Any issues that surface before admission into our system after this point will appear as either error or missed success. Also issues encountered after the first attempt to emit the webhook will continue to be retried, until it is successfully delivered to the webhook endpoint.

The other cases that are reflected in the availability dashboard after manual detection are (not system error):

Meta authentication issues like auth token (security libraries) are determined whether they are legitimate requests failing authentication or authorization.
Validation that rejects legitimate requests.

In both cases WhatsApp will detect and account for those issues after the fact, near real time, but not real time.

**Are there product service level agreements available for uptime and/or latency?**

We do not currently offer commercially available product service level agreements for uptime and/or latency.

**What will disaster recovery look like: if a region is unavailable, how much time does it take to move messages to another region?**

We will have disaster recovery and data replication across multiple regions. The expected downtime would be within our SLA and usually in the order of less than a minute to less than five minutes.
