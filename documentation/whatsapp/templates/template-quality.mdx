# Template quality rating

Updated: Oct 29, 2025

Every template has a quality rating based on usage, customer feedback, and engagement. Templates can have the following ratings, as reported by the API:

`GREEN` — Indicates high quality. The template has received little to no negative feedback from WhatsApp users. The template can be sent.
`YELLOW` — Indicates medium quality. The template has received negative feedback from multiple WhatsApp users, or low read-rates, and may soon become paused or disabled. Message templates with this status can still be sent.
`RED` — Indicates low quality. The template has received negative feedback from multiple WhatsApp users, or low read-rates. The template can be sent, but is in danger of being paused or disabled soon. We recommend that you address the issues that users are reporting. are reporting.
`UNKNOWN` — Indicates a quality score is still pending, because it has yet to receive WhatsApp user feedback or read-rate data. The template can be sent.

Newly created templates have a quality score of `UNKNOWN`, but their rating will change automatically as usage, feedback, and engagement signal is collected over time.

Quality ratings factor into [template pacing](https://developers.facebook.com/documentation/business-messaging/whatsapp/templates/template-pacing) and [template pausing](https://developers.facebook.com/documentation/business-messaging/whatsapp/templates/template-pausing), which can affect template delivery. If a template continuously receives negative feedback or low engagement, it can eventually affect the template’s status. If the status changes to anything other than `APPROVED`, the template cannot be sent in template messages unless its `APPROVED` status is restored.
