# Groups API

Updated: Nov 14, 2025

The Groups API enables you to programmatically create groups for messaging and collaboration.

## How it works

Groups are an invite-only experience where participants join using a group invite link you send them. This invite link provides context about the group, helping the user decide whether they want to join.
