# User-initiated calls

Updated: Nov 13, 2025

## Overview

The Calling API supports receiving calls made by WhatsApp users to your business.

Your business dictates when calls can be received by [configuring business calling hours and holiday unavailability](https://developers.facebook.com/documentation/business-messaging/whatsapp/calling/call-settings#parameter-details).

**Consumer device eligibility**

Currently, the WhatsApp Business Calling API can only accept calls that originate from a consumer’s primary device. Calls originating from a consumer’s companion devices will be rejected.

A **primary device** is the consumer’s main device, typically a mobile phone, which holds the authoritative state for the user’s account. It has full access to messaging history and core functionalities. There is exactly one primary device per user account at any given time.

**Companion devices** are additional devices registered to the user’s account that can operate alongside the primary device. Examples include web clients, desktop apps, tablets, and smart glasses. Companion devices have access to some or all messaging history and core features but are limited compared to the primary device. They can function independently for a period but currently are not supported for calls.

## Prerequisites

Before you get started with user-initiated calling, ensure that:

## User-initiated calling flow

### Part 1: A WhatsApp user calls your business from their client app

When a WhatsApp user calls your business, a Call Connect webhook will be triggered with an `SDP Offer`:

```
\{
  "object": "whatsapp_business_account",
  "entry": [\
    {\
      "id": "366634483210360", // WhatsApp Business Account ID associated with the business phone number\
      "changes": [\
        {\
          "value": {\
            "messaging_product": "whatsapp",\
            "metadata": { // ID and display number for the business phone number placing the call (caller)\
              "phone_number_id": "436666719526789",\
              "display_phone_number": "13175551399",\
            },\
            "calls": [\
              {\
                "id": "wacid.ABGGFjFVU2AfAgo6V-Hc5eCgK5Gh", // The WhatsApp call ID\
                "to": "16315553601", // The WhatsApp user's phone number (callee)\
                "from": "13175551399",\
                "event": "connect",\
                "timestamp": "1671644824",\
                "session": {\
                  "sdp_type": "offer",\
                  "sdp": "<<RFC 8866 SDP>>"\
                }\
              }\
            ]\
          },\
          "field": "calls"\
        }\
      ]\
    }\
  ]
}
```

### Part 2: Your business pre-accepts the call (Recommended)

In essence, when you pre-accept an inbound call, you are allowing the calling media connection to be established before attempting to send call media through the connection.

Pre-accepting calls is recommended because it facilitates faster connection times and avoids [audio clipping issues](https://developers.facebook.com/documentation/business-messaging/whatsapp/calling/troubleshooting#audio-clipping-issue-and-solution).

To pre-accept, You call the `POST &lt;PHONE_NUMBER_ID&gt;/calls` endpoint with the `call_id` from the previous webhook, an `action` of `pre-accept`, and an `SDP Answer`:

```
POST &lt;PHONE_NUMBER_ID&gt;/calls
\{
  "messaging_product": "whatsapp",
  "call_id": "wacid.ABGGFjFVU2AfAgo6V-Hc5eCgK5Gh",
  "action": "pre_accept",
  "session": {
     "sdp_type": "answer"
     "sdp": "<<RFC 8866 SDP>>"
  }
}
```

If there are no errors, you’ll receive a success response:

```
\{
  "success" : true
}
```

### Part 3: Your business accepts the call after the WebRTC connection is made

Once the WebRTC connection is made on your end, you can accept the call.

Once you accept the call, wait until you receive a `200 OK` back from the endpoint. Media will begin flowing immediately since the connection was established prior to call connect.

You can now call the `POST &lt;PHONE_NUMBER_ID&gt;/calls` endpoint with the following request body to accept the call:

```
POST &lt;PHONE_NUMBER_ID&gt;/calls
\{
  "messaging_product": "whatsapp",
  "call_id": "wacid.ABGGFjFVU2AfAgo6V-Hc5eCgK5Gh",
  "action": "accept",
  "session" : {
      "sdp_type" : "answer",
      "sdp" : "<<RFC 8866 SDP>>"
   },
}
```

### Part 4: Your business or the WhatsApp user terminates the call

Both the business or the WhatsApp user can terminate the call at any time.

You call the `POST &lt;PHONE_NUMBER_ID&gt;/calls` endpoint with the following request body to terminate the call:

```
POST &lt;PHONE_NUMBER_ID&gt;/calls
\{
  "messaging_product": "whatsapp",
  "call_id": "wacid.ABGGFjFVU2AfAgo6V-Hc5eCgK5Gh",
  "action" : "terminate"
}
```

If there are no errors, you’ll receive a success response:

```
\{
  "success" : true
}
```

When either the business or the WhatsApp user terminates the call, you receive a Call Terminate webhook:

```
\{
  "object": "whatsapp_business_account",
  "entry": [\
    {\
      "id": "366634483210360", // WhatsApp Business Account ID associated with the business phone number\
      "changes": [\
        {\
          "value": {\
            "messaging_product": "whatsapp",\
            "metadata": { // ID and display number for the business phone number placing the call (caller)\
              "phone_number_id": "436666719526789"\
              "display_phone_number": "13175551399",\
\
            },\
            "calls": [\
              {\
                "id": "wacid.ABGGFjFVU2AfAgo6V-Hc5eCgK5Gh",\
                "to": "16315553601", // The WhatsApp user's phone number (callee)\
                "from": "13175551399", // The business phone number placing the call (caller)\
                "event": "terminate",\
                "direction": "USER_INITIATED",\
                "timestamp": "1749197480",\
                "status": ["Failed", "Completed"],\
                "start_time": "1671644824", // Call start UNIX timestamp\
                "end_time": "1671644944", // Call end UNIX timestamp\
                "duration": 480 // Call duration in seconds\
              }\
            ]\
          },\
          "field": "calls"\
        }\
      ]\
    }\
  ]
}
```

## Endpoints for user-initiated calling

### Pre-accept call

In essence, when you pre-accept an inbound call, you are allowing the calling media connection to be established before attempting to send call media through the connection.

When you then call the accept call endpoint, media begins flowing immediately since the connection has already been established

Pre-accepting calls is recommended because it facilitates faster connection times and avoids [audio clipping issues](https://developers.facebook.com/documentation/business-messaging/whatsapp/calling/troubleshooting#audio-clipping-issue-and-solution).

There is about 30 to 60 seconds after the [Call Connect webhook](https://developers.facebook.com/documentation/business-messaging/whatsapp/calling/user-initiated-calls#call-connect-webhook) is sent for the business to accept the phone call. If the business does not respond, the call is terminated on the WhatsApp user side with a “Not Answered” notification and a [Terminate Webhook](https://developers.facebook.com/documentation/business-messaging/whatsapp/calling/user-initiated-calls#call-terminate-webhook) is delivered back to you.

**Note:** Since the WebRTC connection is established before calling the [Accept Call endpoint](https://developers.facebook.com/documentation/business-messaging/whatsapp/calling/user-initiated-calls#accept-call), make sure to flow the call media only after you receive a 200 OK response back.

If call media flows too early, the caller will miss the first few words of the call. If call media flows too late, callers will hear silence.

### Terminate call

Use this endpoint to terminate an active call.

This must be done even if there is an `RTCP BYE` packet in the media path. Ending the call this way also ensures pricing is more accurate.

When the WhatsApp user terminates the call, you do not have to call this endpoint. Once the call is successfully terminated, a [Call Terminate Webhook](https://developers.facebook.com/documentation/business-messaging/whatsapp/calling/user-initiated-calls#call-terminate-webhook) will be sent to you.

## Webhooks for user-initiated calling

With all Calling API webhooks, there is a `”calls”` object inside the `”value”` object of the webhook response. The `”calls”` object contains metadata about the call that is used to action on each call received by your business.

To receive Calling API webhooks, subscribe to the calls webhook field.

[Learn more about Cloud API webhooks here](https://developers.facebook.com/documentation/business-messaging/whatsapp/webhooks/overview)

### Call Connect webhook

A webhook notification is sent in near real-time when a call initiated by your business is ready to be connected to the whatsapp user (an `SDP Answer`).

Critically, the webhook contains information required to establish a call connection via WebRTC.

Once you receive the Call Connect webhook, you can apply the `SDP Answer` received in the webhook to your WebRTC stack in order to initiate the media connection.

## Dual tone multi frequency (DTMF) support

**The dialpad provided by the Calling API only supports DTMF use cases.**

It does not support consumer-to-consumer calls and does not change any other calling behaviors. For example, the dialpad cannot be used to dial a number and initiate a call or message on WhatsApp.

WhatsApp Business Calling API supports DTMF tones, with the intention to enable BSP applications to support IVR-based systems.

WhatsApp users can press tone buttons on their client app and these DTMF tones are injected into the WebRTC RTP stream established as a part of the VoIP connection.

Our WebRTC stream conforms to [RFC 4733](https://l.facebook.com/l.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fdatatracker.ietf.org%2Fdoc%2Fhtml%2Frfc4733&h=AT37B8gVKpEvmW0kiwU2dTePlwjNQtwX9k570X7DxvbbazLpDpZWmwsNMHXzEd9wbkYeERRerklvFh1e1jOku76eRuhZgwkmqL1IK42TkCA1td0CsJMU1-hDmvRzk92F_BNtkOU42-I07g) for the transfer of DTMF Digits via RTP Payload.

There is no webhook for conveying DTMF digits.

### DTMF clock rate

Only 8000 clock rate is supported in our SDPs. For user-initiated calls, our SDP offer includes only 8000 clock rate. For business-initiated calls, we expect your SDP offer to have 8000 clock rate. Even if it is absent, we’ll still go ahead with 8000 clock rate against payload type 126.

The RTP packets representing DTMF events will use the same timestamp base and sequence number base as the regular audio packets. So you don’t have to worry about differing clock rates between audio packets and DTMF packets. The [duration field](https://l.facebook.com/l.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fdatatracker.ietf.org%2Fdoc%2Fhtml%2Frfc4733%23section-2.3.5&h=AT37B8gVKpEvmW0kiwU2dTePlwjNQtwX9k570X7DxvbbazLpDpZWmwsNMHXzEd9wbkYeERRerklvFh1e1jOku76eRuhZgwkmqL1IK42TkCA1td0CsJMU1-hDmvRzk92F_BNtkOU42-I07g) of the DTMF packet is calculated using 8000 clock units.

We don’t support 48000 clock rate for DTMF

### Sending DTMF digits on consumer WhatsApp client

WhatsApp client applications are enhanced to have a dialpad for calls with CloudAPI business phone numbers. The WhatsApp user can press the buttons on the dialpad and send DTMF tones.

## SDP Overview and Sample SDP Structures

Session Description Protocol (SDP) is a text-based format used to describe the characteristics of multimedia sessions, such as voice and video calls, in real-time communication applications. SDP provides a standardized way to convey information about the session’s media streams, including the type of media, codecs, protocols, and other parameters necessary for establishing and managing the session.

In the context of WebRTC, SDP is used to negotiate the media parameters between the sender and receiver, enabling them to agree on the specifics of the media exchange.
