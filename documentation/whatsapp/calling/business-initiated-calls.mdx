# Business-initiated calls

## Overview

The Calling API supports making calls to WhatsApp users from your business.

The user dictates when calls can be received by [granting call permissions to the business phone number](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/whatsapp/cloud-api/calling/user-call-permissions).

( _Right click image and choose "Open in new tab" for enlarged image_)

_Note: The `ACCEPTED` call status webhook will typically always arrive after the call has been established. It is primarily sent for call event auditing._

## Prerequisites

Before you get started with business-initiated calling, ensure that:

- [Subscribe](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/whatsapp/webhooks/create-webhook-endpoint#configure-webhooks) to the "calls" webhook field
- [Calling APIs are enabled on your business phone number](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/whatsapp/cloud-api/calling/call-settings)

Lastly, **before you can call a WhatsApp user, you must obtain their permission to do so.**

[Learn how to obtain WhatsApp user calling permissions here](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/whatsapp/cloud-api/calling/user-call-permissions)

## Business-initiated calling flow

### Part 1: Obtain permission to call the WhatsApp user

Obtaining call permissions from the WhatsApp user can be done in one of the following ways:

#### Send a call permission request message

You can request call permissions by sending the WhatsApp user a permission request, either as a free form message during an open customer service window, or by using a template message that contains the request.

- [Learn how to send a **free form** call permission request](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/whatsapp/cloud-api/calling/user-call-permissions#how-to-send-a-free-form-call-permission-request-message)
- [Learn how to send a **template** call permission request](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/whatsapp/cloud-api/calling/user-call-permissions#how-to-create-and-send-call-permission-request-template-messages)

#### Enable `callback_permission_status` in call settings

When `callback_permission_status` is enabled, the user automatically provides call permission to your business when they place a call to you.

[Learn how to enable `callback_permission_status`](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/whatsapp/cloud-api/calling/call-settings#configure-update-business-phone-number-calling-settings)

#### WhatsApp user grants permanent permissions

The user can also grant permanent permissions to the business at any time through their business profile.

### Part 2: Your business initiates a new call to the WhatsApp user

Now that you have user permission, you can initiate a new call to the WhatsApp user in question.

You can now call the `POST &lt;PHONE_NUMBER_ID&gt;/calls` endpoint with the following request body to initiate a new call:

```https
POST &lt;PHONE_NUMBER_ID&gt;/calls
\{
  "messaging_product": "whatsapp",
  "to":"12185552828", // The WhatsApp user's phone number (callee)
  "action":"connect",
  "session" : {
      "sdp_type" : "offer",
      "sdp" : "<<RFC 8866 SDP>>"
  }
}
```

If there are no errors, you will receive a successful response:

```https
\{
  "messaging_product": "whatsapp",
  "calls" : [\
     "id" : "wacid.HBgLMTIxODU1NTI4MjgVAgARGCAyODRQIAFRoA", // The WhatsApp call ID\
   ]
}
```

_Note: Response with error code `138006` indicates a lack of a call request permission for this business number from the WhatsApp user._

### Part 3: You establish the call connection using webhook signaling

After successful initiation of a new call, you will receive a Call Connect webhook response that contains an `SDP Answer` from Cloud API. Your business will then apply the `SDP Answer` from this webhook to your WebRTC stack in order to initiate the media connection.

```https
\{
    "entry": [\

            "changes": [\

                                    }\
                                },\

                            }\
                        ],\
                        "metadata": { // ID and display number for the business phone number placing the call (caller)\
                            "phone_number_id": "436666719526789",\
                            "display_phone_number": "13175551399"\
                        },\
                        "messaging_product": "whatsapp"\
                    }\
                }\
            ],\
            "id": "366634483210360" // WhatsApp Business Account ID associated with the business phone number\
        }\
    ],
    "object": "whatsapp_business_account"
},
```

You then receive an appropriate status webhook, indicating that the call is `RINGING`, `ACCEPTED`, or `REJECTED`:

```https
\{
  "entry": [\
    {\
      "changes": [\
        {\
          "field": "calls",\
          "value": {\
            "statuses": [\
              {\
                "id": "wacid.HBgLMTIxODU1NTI4MjgVAgARGCAyODRQIAFRoA", // The WhatsApp call ID\
                "type": "call",\
                "status": "[RINGING|ACCEPTED|REJECTED]", // The current call status\
                "timestamp": "1749197000",\
                "recipient_id": "12185552828" // The WhatsApp user's phone number (callee)\
              }\
            ],\
            "metadata": { // ID and display number for the business phone number placing the call (caller)\
              "phone_number_id": "436666719526789",\
              "display_phone_number": "13175551399"\
            },\
            "messaging_product": "whatsapp"\
          }\
        }\
      ],\
      "id": "366634483210360" // WhatsApp Business Account ID associated with the business phone number\
    }\
  ],
  "object": "whatsapp_business_account"
}
```

### Part 4: Your business or the WhatsApp user terminates the call

Both you or the WhatsApp user can terminate the call at any time.

You call the `POST &lt;PHONE_NUMBER_ID&gt;/calls` endpoint with the following request body to terminate the call:

```curl
POST &lt;PHONE_NUMBER_ID&gt;/calls
\{
  "messaging_product": "whatsapp",
  "call_id": "wacid.HBgLMTIxODU1NTI4MjgVAgARGCAyODRQIAFRoA", // The WhatsApp call ID
  "action" : "terminate"
}
```

If there are no errors, you will receive a success response:

```https
\{
  "success" : true
}
```

When either the business or the WhatsApp user terminates the call, you receive a Call Terminate webhook:

```https
\{
  "object": "whatsapp_business_account",
  "entry": [\
    {\
      "id": "366634483210360", // WhatsApp Business Account ID associated with the business phone number\
      "changes": [\
        {\
          "value": {\

              "phone_number_id": "436666719526789"\
              "display_phone_number": "13175551399",\
\
            },\
            "calls": [\
              {\
                "id": "wacid.HBgLMTIxODU1NTI4MjgVAgARGCAyODRQIAFRoA",\
                "to": "12185552828", // The WhatsApp user's phone number (callee)\
                "from": "13175551399", // The business phone number placing the call (caller)\
                "event": "terminate",\
                "direction": "BUSINESS_INITIATED",\
                "timestamp": "1749197480",\
                "status": ["Failed", "Completed"],\
                "start_time": "1671644824", // Call start UNIX timestamp\
                "end_time": "1671644944", // Call end UNIX timestamp\
                "duration": 480 // Call duration in seconds\
              }\
            ]\
          },\
          "field": "calls"\
        }\
      ]\
    }\
  ]
}
```

### Terminate call

Use this endpoint to terminate an active call.

This must be done even if there is an `RTCP BYE` packet in the media path. Ending the call this way also ensures pricing is more accurate.

When the WhatsApp user terminates the call, you do not have to call this endpoint. Once the call is successfully terminated, a [Call Terminate Webhook](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/whatsapp/cloud-api/calling/business-initiated-calls#call-terminate-webhook) will be sent to you.

#### Request syntax

```https

[View general Cloud API Error Codes here](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/whatsapp/cloud-api/support/error-codes)

## Webhooks for business-initiated calling

With all Calling API webhooks, there is a `”calls”` object inside the `”value”` object of the webhook response. The `”calls”` object contains metadata about the call that is used to action on each call placed or received by your business.

To receive Calling API webhooks, subscribe to the "calls" webhook field.

[Learn more about Cloud API webhooks here](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/whatsapp/cloud-api/webhooks/components#statuses-object)

### Call connect webhook

A webhook notification is sent in near real-time when a call initiated by your business is ready to be connected to the whatsapp user (an `SDP Answer`).

Critically, the webhook contains information required to establish a call connection via WebRTC.

Once you receive the Call Connect webhook, you can apply the `SDP Answer` received in the webhook to your WebRTC stack in order to initiate the media connection.

### Call status webhook

This webhook is sent during the following calling events:

1. Ringing: When the WhatsApp user’s client device begins ringing
2. Accepted: When the WhatsApp user accepts the call
3. Rejected: When the call is rejected by the WhatsApp user. You'll also receive the call terminate webhook in this case

The Webhook structure here is similar to the Status webhooks used for the Cloud API messages.

## SDP overview and sample SDP structures

Session Description Protocol (SDP) is a text-based format used to describe the characteristics of multimedia sessions, such as voice and video calls, in real-time communication applications. SDP provides a standardized way to convey information about the session's media streams, including the type of media, codecs, protocols, and other parameters necessary for establishing and managing the session.

In the context of WebRTC, SDP is used to negotiate the media parameters between the sender and receiver, enabling them to agree on the specifics of the media exchange.
