# Embedded Signup Flow Errors

Updated: Nov 10, 2025

This guide helps you get acquainted with the different errors that may arise as you [embed the signup flow](https://developers.facebook.com/documentation/business-messaging/whatsapp/embedded-signup/implementation) in your website or client portal.

## Abandoned Flow Screens

If a business customer prematurely abandons the Embedded Signup flow, we will send a [message event](https://developers.facebook.com/documentation/business-messaging/whatsapp/embedded-signup/implementation#session-logging-message-event-listener) to the browser that spawned the flow, that indicates which screen the customer was viewing when they abandoned the flow.

The `data.current_step` property value indicates which screen the customer abandoned:

```
\{
  data: {
    current_step: "&lt;CURRENT_STEP&gt;",
  },
  type: "WA_EMBEDDED_SIGNUP",
  event: "CANCEL",
  version: 3
}
```

| Current step value | Corresponding screen |
| --- | --- |
| `&lt;BUSINESS_ACCOUNT_SELECTION&gt;` | [Business portfolio screen](https://developers.facebook.com/documentation/business-messaging/whatsapp/embedded-signup/default-flow#business-portfolio-screen) |
